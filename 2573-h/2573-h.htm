<h1>THE CAGED LION</h1>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>When the venture has been made of dealing with historical events
and characters, it always seems fair towards the reader to avow what
liberties have been taken, and how much of the sketch is founded on
history.&nbsp; In the present case, it is scarcely necessary to do more
than refer to the almost unique relations that subsisted between Henry
V. and his prisoner, James I. of Scotland; who lived with him throughout
his reign on the terms of friend rather than of captive, and was absolutely
sheltered by this imprisonment throughout his nonage and early youth
from the frightful violence and presumption of the nobles of his kingdom.</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s expedition to Scotland is wholly imaginary, though
there appears to have been space for it during Henry&rsquo;s progress
to the North to pay his devotions at Beverley Minster.&nbsp; The hero
of the story is likewise invention, though, as Froissart ascribes to
King Robert II. &lsquo;eleven sons who loved arms,&rsquo; Malcolm may
well be supposed to be the son of one of those unaccounted for in the
pedigrees of Stewart.&nbsp; The same may be said of Esclairmonde.&nbsp;
There were plenty of Luxemburgs in the Low Countries, but the individual
is not to be identified.&nbsp; Readers of Tyler&rsquo;s &lsquo;Henry
V.,&rsquo; of Agnes Strickland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Queens,&rsquo; Tytler&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Scotland,&rsquo; and Barante&rsquo;s &lsquo;Histoire de Bourgogne&rsquo;
will be at no loss for the origin of all I have ventured to say of the
really historical personages.&nbsp; Mr. Fox Bourne&rsquo;s &lsquo;English
Merchants&rsquo; furnished the tradition respecting Whittington.&nbsp;
I am afraid the knighthood was really conferred on Henry&rsquo;s first
return to England, after the battle of Agincourt; but human&mdash;or
at least story-telling&mdash;nature could not resist an anachronism
of a few years for such a story.&nbsp; The only other wilful alteration
of a matter of time is with regard to the Duke of Burgundy&rsquo;s interview
with Henry.&nbsp; At the time of Henry&rsquo;s last stay at Paris the
Duke was attending the death-bed of his wife, Michelle of France, but
he had been several times in the King&rsquo;s camp at the siege of Meaux.</p>
<p>Another alteration of fact is that Ralf Percy, instead of being second
son of Hotspur, should have been Henry Percy, son of Hotspur&rsquo;s
brother Ralf; but the name would have been so confusing that it was
thought better to set Dugdale at defiance and consider the reader&rsquo;s
convenience.&nbsp; Alice Montagu, though her name sounds as if it came
out of the most commonplace novelist&rsquo;s repertory, was a veritable
personage&mdash;the heiress of the brave line of Montacute, or Montagu;
daughter to the Earl of Salisbury who was killed at the siege of Orleans;
wife to the Earl of the same title (in her right) who won the battle
of Blore Heath and was beheaded at Wakefield; and mother to Earl Warwick
the King-maker, the Marquis of Montagu, and George Nevil, Archbishop
of York.&nbsp; As nothing is known of her but her name, I have ventured
to make use of the blank.</p>
<p>For Jaqueline of Hainault, and her pranks, they are to be found in
Monstrelet of old, and now in Barante; though justice to her and Queen
Isabeau compels me to state that the incident of the ring is wholly
fictitious.&nbsp; Of the trial of Walter Stewart no record is preserved
save that he was accused of &lsquo;<i>roborica</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; James
Kennedy was the first great benefactor to learning in Scotland, and
founder of her earliest University, having been himself educated at
Paris.</p>
<p>The Abbey of Coldingham is described from a local compilation of
the early part of the century, with an account of the history of that
grand old foundation, and the struggle for appointments between the
parent house at Durham and the Scottish Government.&nbsp; Priors Akefield
and Drax are historical, and as the latter really did commission a body
of moss-troopers to divert an instalment of King James&rsquo;s ransom
into his own private coffers, I do not think I can have done him much
injustice.&nbsp; As the nunnery of St. Abbs has gone bodily into the
sea, I have been the less constrained by the inconvenient action of
fact upon fiction.&nbsp; And for the Hospital of St. Katharine&rsquo;s-by-the-Tower,
its history is to be found in Stowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Survey of London,&rsquo;
and likewise in the evidence before the Parliamentary Commission, which
shows what it was intended by Queen Philippa to have been to the river-side
population, and what it might have been had such intentions been understood
and acted on&mdash;nay, what it may yet become, since the foundation
remains intact, although the building has been removed.</p>

<p>November 24, 1869.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I: THE GUEST OF GLENUSKIE</h2>
<p>A master hand has so often described the glens and ravines of Scotland,
that it seems vain and presumptuous to meddle with them; and yet we
must ask our readers to figure to themselves a sharp cleft sloping downwards
to a brawling mountain stream, the sides scattered with gray rocks of
every imaginable size, interspersed here and there with heather, gorse,
or furze.&nbsp; Just in the widest part of the valley, a sort of platform
of rock jutted out from the hill-side, and afforded a station for one
of those tall, narrow, grim-looking fastnesses that were the strength
of Scotland, as well as her bane.</p>
<p>Either by nature or art, the rock had been scarped away on three
sides, so that the walls of the castle rose sheer from the steep descent,
except where the platform was connected with the mountain side by, as
it were, an isthmus joining the peninsula to the main rock; and even
this isthmus, a narrow ridge of rock just wide enough for the passage
of a single horse, had been cut through, no doubt with great labour,
and rendered impassable, except by the lowering of a drawbridge.&nbsp;
Glenuskie Castle was thus nearly impregnable, so long as it was supplied
with water, and for this all possible provision had been made, by guiding
a stream into the court.</p>
<p>The castle was necessarily narrow and confined; its massive walls
took up much even of the narrow space that the rock afforded; but it
had been so piled up that it seemed as though the builders wished to
make height compensate for straitness.&nbsp; There was, too, an unusual
amount of grace, both in the outline of the gateway with its mighty
flanking towers, and of the lofty donjon tower, that shot up like a
great finger above the Massy More, as the main building was commonly
called by the inhabitants of Glenuskie.</p>
<p>Wondrous as were the walls, and deep-set as were the arches, they
had all that peculiar slenderness of contour that Scottish taste seemed
to have learnt from France; and a little more space was gained at the
top, both of the gateway towers and the donjon, by a projecting cornice
of beautifully vaulted arches supporting a battlement, that gave the
building a crowned look.&nbsp; On the topmost tower was of course planted
the ensign of the owner, and that ensign was no other than the regal
ruddy Lion of Scotland, ramping on his gold field within his tressure
fiery and counter flory, but surmounted by a label divided into twelve,
and placed upon a pen-noncel, or triangular piece of silk.&nbsp; The
eyes of the early fifteenth century easily deciphered such hieroglyphics
as these, which to every one with the least tincture of &lsquo;the noble
science&rsquo; indicated that the owner of the castle was of royal Stewart
blood, but of a younger branch, and not yet admitted to the rank of
knighthood.</p>
<p>The early spring of the year 1421 was bleak and dreary in that wild
lonely vale, and large was the fire burning on the hearth in the castle
hall, in the full warmth of which there sat, with a light blue cloth
cloak drawn tightly round him, a tall old man, of the giant mould of
Scotland, and with a massive thoughtful brow, whose grand form was rendered
visible by the absence of hair, only a few remnants of yellow locks
mixed with silver floating from his temples to mingle with his magnificent
white beard.&nbsp; A small blue bonnet, with a short eagle feather,
fastened with a brooch of river pearl, was held in the hands that were
clasped over his face, as, bending down in his chair, he murmured through
his white beard, &lsquo;Have mercy, good Lord, have mercy on the land.&nbsp;
Have mercy on my son,&mdash;and guard him when he goes out and when
he comes in.&nbsp; Have mercy on the children I have toiled for, and
teach me to judge and act for them aright in these sore straits; and
above all, have mercy on our King, break his fetters, and send him home
to be the healer of his land, the avenger of her cruel wrongs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So absorbed was the old man that he never heard the step that came
across the hall.&nbsp; It was a slightly unequal step, but was carefully
hushed at entrance, as if supposing the old man asleep; and at a slow
pace the new-comer crossed the hall to the chimney, where he stood by
the fire, warming himself and looking wistfully at the old Knight.</p>
<p>He was wrapped in a plaid, black and white, which increased the gray
appearance of the pale sallow face and sad expression of the wearer,
a boy of about seventeen, with soft pensive dark eyes and a sickly complexion,
with that peculiar wistful cast of countenance that is apt to accompany
deformity, though there was no actual malformation apparent, unless
such might be reckoned the slight halt in the gait, and the small stature
of the lad, who was no taller than many boys of twelve or fourteen.&nbsp;
But there was a depth of melancholy in those dark brown eyes, that went
far into the heart of any one who had the power to be touched with their
yearning, appealing, almost piteous gaze, as though their owner had
come into a world that was much too hard for him, and were looking out
in bewilderment and entreaty for some haven of peace.</p>
<p>He had stood for some minutes looking thoughtfully into the fire,
and the sadness of his expression ever deepening, before the old man
raised his face, and said, &lsquo;You here, Malcolm? where are the others?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Patie and Lily are still on the turret-top, fair Uncle,&rsquo;
returned the boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was so cold;&rsquo; and he shivered
again, and seemed as though he would creep into the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the reek?&rsquo; asked the uncle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is another reek broken out farther west,&rsquo; replied
Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Patie is sure now that it is as you deemed, Uncle;
that it is a cattle-lifting from Badenoch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heaven help them!&rsquo; sighed the old man, again folding
his hands in prayer.&nbsp; &lsquo;How long, O Lord, how long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm took up the appeal of the Psalm, repeating it in Latin, but
with none the less fervency; that Psalm that has ever since David&rsquo;s
time served as the agonized voice of hearts hot-burning at the sight
of wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah yes,&rsquo; he ended, &lsquo;there is nothing else for
it!&nbsp; Uncle, this was wherefore I came.&nbsp; It was to speak to
you of my purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old purpose, Malcolm?&nbsp; Nay, that hath been answered
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But listen, listen, dear Uncle.&nbsp; I have not spoken of
it for a full year now.&nbsp; So that you cannot say it is the caresses
of the good monks.&nbsp; No, nor the rude sayings of the Master of Albany,&rsquo;
he added, colouring at a look of his uncle.&nbsp; &lsquo;You bade me
say no more till I be of full age; nor would I, save that I were safe
lodged in an abbey; then might Patrick and Lily be wedded, and he not
have to leave us and seek his fortune far away in France; and in Patie&rsquo;s
hands and leading, my vassals might be safe; but what could the doited
helpless cripple do?&rsquo; he added, the colour rising hotly to his
cheek with pain and shame.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Sir, let me but save my
soul, and find peace in Coldingham!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor bairn,&rsquo; said his uncle, laying a kind hand upon
him, as in his eagerness he knelt on one knee beside the chair, &lsquo;it
must not be.&nbsp; It is true that the Regent and his sons would willingly
see you in a cloister.&nbsp; Nay, that unmanly jeer of Walter Stewart&rsquo;s
was, I verily believe, meant to drive you thither.&nbsp; But were you
there, then would poor Lilias become a prize worth having, and the only
question would be, whether Walter of Albany, or Robert of Athole, or
any of the rest of them, should tear her away to be the lady of their
fierce ungodly households.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You could give her to Patrick, Uncle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Malcolm, that were not consistent with mine honour, or
oaths to the King and State.&nbsp; You living, and Laird of Glenuskie,
Lilias is a mere younger sister, whom you may give in marriage as you
will; but were you dead to the world, under a cowl, then the Lady of
Glenuskie, a king&rsquo;s grandchild, may not be disposed of, save by
her royal kinsman, or by those who, woe worth the day! stand in his
place.&nbsp; I were no better than yon Wolf of Badenoch or the Master
of Albany, did I steal a march on the Regent, and give the poor lassie
to my own son!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so Lilias must pine, and Patrick wander off to the weary
French war,&rsquo; sighed Malcolm; &lsquo;and I must be scorned by my
cousins whenever the House of Stewart meets together; and must strive
with these fierce cruel men, that will ever be too hard for me when
Patie is gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; His eyes filled with tears as he continued,
&lsquo;Ah! that fair chapel, with the sweet chant of the choir, the
green smooth-shaven quadrangle, the calm cloister walk; there, there
alone is rest.&nbsp; There, one ceases to be a prey and a laughing-stock;
there, one sees no more bloodshed and spulzie; there, one need not be
forced to treachery or violence.&nbsp; Oh, Uncle! my very soul is sick
for Coldingham.&nbsp; How many years will it be ere I can myself bestow
my sister on Patie, and hide my head in peace!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before his uncle had done more than answer, &lsquo;Nay, nay, Malcolm,
these are no words for the oe of Bruce; you are born to dare as well
as to suffer,&rsquo; there was an approach of footsteps, and two young
people entered the hall; the first a girl, with a family likeness to
Malcolm, but tall, upright, beautiful, and with the rich colouring of
perfect health, her plaid still hanging in a loose swelling hood round
her brilliant face and dark hair, snooded with a crimson ribbon and
diamond clasp; the other, a knightly young man, of stately height and
robust limbs, keen bright blue eyes and amber hair and beard, moving
with the ease and grace that showed his training in the highest school
of chivalry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Uncle,&rsquo; cried the maiden in eager excitement, &lsquo;there
is a guest coming.&nbsp; He has just turned over the brae side, and
can be coming nowhere but here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A guest!&rsquo; cried both Malcolm and the elder knight, &lsquo;of
what kind, Lily?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A knight&mdash;a knight in bright steel, and with three attendants,&rsquo;
said Lilias; &lsquo;one of Patrick&rsquo;s French comrades, say I, by
the grace of his riding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a message from the Regent, I trust,&rsquo; sighed Malcolm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Patie, oh do not lower the drawbridge, till we hear whether it
be friend or foe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, Malcolm, &rsquo;tis well none save friends heard that,&rsquo;
said Patrick.&nbsp; &lsquo;When shall we make a brave man of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nevertheless, Patie,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;though
I had rather the caution had come from the eldest rather than the youngest
head among us, parley as much as may serve with honour and courtesy
ere opening the gate to the stranger.&nbsp; Hark, there is his bugle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A certain look of nervous terror passed over young Malcolm&rsquo;s
face, while his sister watched full of animation and curiosity, as one
to whom excitement of any kind could hardly come amiss, exclaiming,
as she looked from the window, &lsquo;Fear not, most prudent Malcolm;
Father Ninian is with him: Father Ninian must have invited him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strange,&rsquo; muttered Patrick, &lsquo;that Father Ninian
should be picking up and bringing home stray wandering land-loupers;&rsquo;
and with an anxious glance at Lilias, he went forward unwillingly to
perform those duties of hospitality which had become necessary, since
the presence of the castle chaplain was a voucher for the guest.&nbsp;
The drawbridge had already been lowered, and the new-comer was crossing
it upon a powerful black steed, guided by Father Ninian upon his rough
mountain pony, on which he had shortly before left the castle, to attend
at a Church festival held at Coldingham.</p>
<p>The chaplain was a wise, prudent, and much-respected man; nevertheless,
young Sir Patrick Drummond felt little esteem for his prudence in displaying
one at least of the treasures of the castle to the knight on the black
horse.&nbsp; The stranger was a very tall man, of robust and stalwart
make, apparently aged about seven or eight and twenty years, clad in
steel armour, enamelled so as to have a burnished blue appearance; but
the vizor of the helmet was raised, and the face beneath it was a manly
open face, thoroughly Scottish in its forms, but very handsome, and
with short dark auburn hair, and eyes of the same peculiar tint, glancing
with a light that once seen could never be forgotten; and the bearing
was such, that Patrick at once growled to himself, &lsquo;One of our
haughty loons, brimful of <i>outre cuidance</i>; and yet how coolly
he bears it off.&nbsp; If he looks to find us his humble servants, he
will find himself mistaken, I trow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir Patrick,&rsquo; said Father Ninian, who was by this time
close to him, &lsquo;let me present to you Sir James Stewart, a captive
knight who is come to collect his ransom.&nbsp; I fell in with him on
the road, and as his road lay with mine, I made bold to assure him of
a welcome from your honoured father and Lord Malcolm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Patrick&rsquo;s face cleared.&nbsp; It was no grace or beauty that
he feared in any stranger, but the sheer might and unright that their
Regency enabled the House of Albany to exercise over the orphans of
the royal family, whose head was absent; and a captive knight could
be no mischievous person.&nbsp; Still this might be only a specious
pretence to impose on the chaplain, and gain admittance to the castle;
and Patrick was resolved to be well on his guard, though he replied
courteously to the graceful bow with which the stranger greeted him,
saying in a manly mellow voice and southern accent, &lsquo;I have been
bold enough to presume on the good father&rsquo;s offer of hospitality,
Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are welcome, Sir,&rsquo; returned Patrick, taking the
stranger&rsquo;s bridle that he might dismount; &lsquo;my father and
my cousin will gladly further on his way a prisoner seeking freedom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A captive may well be welcome, for the sake of one prisoner,&rsquo;
said his father, who had in the meantime come forward, and extended
his hand to the knight, who took it, and uncovering his bright locks,
respectfully said, &lsquo;I am in the presence of the noble Tutor of
Glenuskie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even so, Sir,&rsquo; returned Sir David Drummond, who was,
in fact, as his nephew&rsquo;s guardian, usually known by this curious
title; &lsquo;and you here see my wards, the Lord Malcolm and Lady Lilias.&nbsp;
Your knighthood will make allowances for the lad, he is but home-bred.&rsquo;&nbsp;
For while Lilias with stately grace responded to Sir James Stewart&rsquo;s
courtly greeting, Malcolm bashfully made an awkward bow, and seemed
ready to shrink within himself, as, indeed, the brutal jests of his
rude cousins had made him dread and hate the eye of a stranger; and
while the knight was led forward to the hall fire, he merely pressed
up to the priest, and eagerly demanded under his breath, &lsquo;Have
you brought me the book?&rsquo; but Father Ninian had only time to nod,
and sign that a volume was in his bosom, before old Sir David called
out, &lsquo;What now, Malcolm, forgetting that your part is to come
and disarm the knight who does you the honour to be your guest?&rsquo;&nbsp;
And Sir Patrick rather roughly pushed him forward, gruffly whispering,
&lsquo;Leave not Lily to supply your lack of courtesy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm shambled forward, bewildered, as the keen auburn eye fell
on him, and the cheery kindly voice said, &lsquo;Ha! a new book&mdash;a
romance?&nbsp; Well may that drive out other thoughts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had he ears to hear such a whisper?&rsquo; thought Malcolm,
as he mumbled in the hoarse voice of bashful boyhood, &lsquo;Not a romance,
Sir, but whatever the good fathers at Coldingham would lend me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the &ldquo;Itinerarium&rdquo; of the blessed Adamnanus,&rsquo;
replied Father Ninian, producing from his bosom a parcel, apparently
done up in many wrappers, a seal-skin above all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The &ldquo;Itinerarium&rdquo;!&rsquo; exclaimed Sir James,
&lsquo;methought I had heard of such a book.&nbsp; I have a friend in
England who would give many a fair rose noble for a sight of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A friend in England!&rsquo;&mdash;the words had a sinister
sound to the audience, and while Malcolm jealously gathered up the book
into his arms, the priest made cold answer, that the book was the property
of the Monastery at Coldingham, and had only been lent to Lord Malcolm
Stewart by special favour.&nbsp; The guest could not help smiling, and
saying he was glad books were thus prized in Scotland; but at that moment,
as the sunny look shone on his face, and he stood before the fire in
the close suit of chamois leather which he wore under his armour, old
Sir David exclaimed, &lsquo;Ha! never did I see such a likeness.&nbsp;
Patie, you should be old enough to remember; do you not see it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What should I see?&nbsp; Who is he like?&rsquo; asked Patrick,
surprised at his father&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; whispered Sir David in a lowered voice; &lsquo;do
you not see it? to the unhappy lad, the Duke of Rothsay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Patrick could not help smiling, for he had been scarcely seven years
old at the time of the murder of the unfortunate Prince of Scotland;
but a flush of colour rose into the face of the guest, and he shortly
answered, &lsquo;So I have been told;&rsquo; and then assuming a seat
near Sir David, he entered into conversation with him upon the condition
of Scotland at the period, inquiring into the state of many of the families
and districts by name.&nbsp; Almost always there was but one answer&mdash;murder&mdash;harrying&mdash;foray;
and when the question followed, &lsquo;What had the Regent done?&rsquo;
there was a shrug of the shoulders, and as often Sir James&rsquo;s face
flushed with a dark red fire, and his hand clenched at the hilt of the
sword by his side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is there not a man in Scotland left to strike for the
right?&rsquo; he demanded at last; &lsquo;cannot nobles, clergy, and
burghers, band themselves in parliament to put down Albany and his bloody
house, and recall their true head?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They love to have it so,&rsquo; returned Sir David sadly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;United, they might be strong enough; but each knows that his
fellow, Douglas, Lennox, March, or Mar, would be ready to play the same
game as Albany; and to raise a rival none will stir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so,&rsquo; proceeded Sir James, bitterly, &lsquo;the manhood
of Scotland goes forth to waste itself in an empty foreign war, merely
to keep France in as wretched a state of misrule as itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, nay, Sir,&rsquo; cried Patrick angrily, &lsquo;it is
to save an ancient ally from the tyranny of our foulest foe.&nbsp; It
is the only place where a Scotsman can seek his fortune with honour,
and without staining his soul with foul deeds.&nbsp; Bring our King
home, and every sword shall be at his service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, when they have all been lavished on the crazy Frenchman?&rsquo;
said Sir James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; said Patrick, rising in his vehemence; &lsquo;when
they have been brightened there by honourable warfare, not tarnished
by home barbarities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He speaks truly,&rsquo; said Sir David; &lsquo;and though
it will go to my heart to part with the lad, yet may I not say a word
to detain him in a land where the contagion of violence can scarce be
escaped by a brave man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir James gave a deep sigh as of pain, but as if to hinder its being
remarked, promptly answered, &lsquo;That may be; but what is to be the
lot of a land whose honest men desert her cause as too evil for them,
and seek out another, that when seen closer is scarce less evil?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How, Sir!&rsquo; cried Patrick; &lsquo;you a prisoner of England,
yet speaking against our noble French allies, so foully trampled on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have lived long enough in England,&rsquo; returned Sir James,
&lsquo;to think that land happiest where law is strong enough to enforce
peace and order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The coward loons!&rsquo; muttered Patrick, chiefly out of
the spirit of opposition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been long in England, Sir?&rsquo; said Lilias, hoping
to direct the conversation into a more peaceful current.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many years, fair lady,&rsquo; he replied, turning courteously
to her; &lsquo;I was taken when I was a mere lad, but I have had gentle
captors, and no over harsh prison.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And has no one ransomed you?&rsquo; she asked pitifully, as
one much moved by a certain patience on his brow, and in his sweet full
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No one, lady.&nbsp; My uncle was but too willing that the
heir should be kept aloof; and it is only now he is dead, that I have
obtained leave from my friendly captor to come in search of my ransom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias would have liked to know the amount, but it was not manners
to ask, since the rate of ransom was the personal value of the knight;
and her uncle put in the question, who was his keeper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Earl of Somerset,&rsquo; rather hastily answered Sir James;
and then at once Lilias exclaimed, &lsquo;Ah, Uncle, is not the King,
too, in his charge?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then questions crowded on.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What like is the King?&nbsp; How brooks he his durance?&nbsp;
What freedom hath he?&nbsp; What hope is there of his return?&nbsp;
Can he brook to hear of his people&rsquo;s wretchedness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was the first question at which Sir James attempted to unclose
his hitherto smiling and amused lip.&nbsp; Then it quivered, and the
dew glittered in his eyes as he answered, &lsquo;Brook it!&nbsp; No
indeed, lady.&nbsp; His heart burns within him at every cry that comes
over the Border, and will well-nigh burst at what I have seen and heard!&nbsp;
King Harry tells him that to send him home were but tossing him on the
swords of the Albany.&nbsp; Better, better so, to die in one grapple
for his country&rsquo;s sake, than lie bound, hearing her bitter wails,
and unable to stir for her redress!&rsquo; and as he dashed the indignant
tear from his eyes, Patrick caught his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your heart is in the right place, friend,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;I look on you as an honest man and brother in arms from this
moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a bargain,&rsquo; said Sir James, the smile returning,
and his eyes again glistening as he wrung Sir Patrick&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When the hour comes for the true rescue of Scotland, we will
strike together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you will tell the King,&rsquo; added Patrick, &lsquo;that
here are true hearts, and I could find many more, only longing to fence
him from the Albany swords, about which King Harry is so good as to
fash himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what like is the King?&rsquo; asked Lilias eagerly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, I would fain see him.&nbsp; Is it true that he was the tallest
man at King Harry&rsquo;s sacring? more shame that he were there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He and I are much of a height, lady,&rsquo; returned the knight.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Maybe I may give you the justest notion of him by saying that
I am said to be his very marrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That explains your likeness to the poor Duke,&rsquo; said
Sir David, satisfied; &lsquo;and you too count kindred with our royal
house, methinks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sprung from Walter the Stewart, so much I know; my lands
lie Carrick-wards,&rsquo; said Sir James lightly, &lsquo;but I have
been a prisoner so long, that the pedigree of my house was never taught
me, and I can make no figure in describing my own descent.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And as though to put an end to the inquiry, he walked to the window,
where Malcolm so soon as they had begun to talk of the misrule of Scotland,
had ensconced himself in the window-seat with his new book, making the
most of the failing light, and asked him whether the Monk of Iona equalled
his expectations.</p>
<p>Malcolm was not easy to draw out at first, but it presently appeared
that he had been baffled by a tough bit of Latinity.&nbsp; The knight
looked, and readily expounded the sentence, so that all became plain;
and then, as it was already too dark to pursue the study with comfort,
he stood over the boy, talking to him of books and of poems, while the
usually pale, listless, uninterested countenance responded by looks
of eager delight and flushing colour.</p>
<p>It seemed as though each were equally pleased with the other: Sir
James, at finding so much knowledge and understanding in a Scottish
castle; and Malcolm, at, for the first time, meeting anything but contempt
for his tastes from aught but an ecclesiastic.</p>
<p>Their talk continued till they were summoned to supper, which had
been somewhat delayed to provide for the new-comers.&nbsp; It was a
simple enough meal, suited to Lent, and was merely of dried fish, with
barley bread and kail brose; but there were few other places in Scotland
where it would have been served with so much of the refinement that
Sir David Drummond and his late wife had learnt in France.&nbsp; A tablecloth
and napkins, separate trenchers, and water for hand cleansing, were
not always to be found in the houses of the nobles; and in fact, there
were those who charged Malcolm&rsquo;s delicacy and timidity on the
<i>nis&eacute;t&eacute;</i> or folly of his effeminate education; the
having the rushes on the floor frequently changed, the preference of
lamps for pine torches, and the not keeping falcons, dogs, swine, and
all, pell mell in the great hall.</p>
<p>Lilias sat between her uncle and his guest, looking so fair and bright
that Patrick felt fresh accesses of angry jealousy, while the visitor
talked as one able to report to the natives from another world, and
that world the hateful England, which as a Scotsman he was bound to
abhor.&nbsp; Had it been France, it had been endurable, but praise of
English habits was mere disloyalty; and yet, whenever Patrick tried
to throw in a disparaging word, he found himself met with a quiet superiority
such as he had believed no knight in Scotland could assume with him,
and still it was neither brow-beating nor insolence, nothing that could
give offence.</p>
<p>Malcolm begged to know whether there had not been a rare good poet
in England, called Chaucer.&nbsp; Verily there had been, said the knight;
and on a little solicitation, so soon as supper was over, he recited
to the eager and delighted auditors the tale of patient Grisel, as rendered
by Chaucer, calling forth eager comments from both Patrick and Lily,
on the unknightliness of the Marquis.&nbsp; Malcolm, however, added,
&lsquo;Yet, after all, she was but a mere peasant wench.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes that, young Sir?&rsquo; replied Sir James gravely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I would have you to know that the husband&rsquo;s rank is the
wife&rsquo;s, and the more unequal were their lot before, the more is
he bound to respect her, and to make her be respected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may be, after the deed is done,&rsquo; said Sir David,
in a warning voice; &lsquo;but it is not well that like should not match
with like.&nbsp; Many an evil have I seen in my time, from unequal mating.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Sir,&rsquo; eagerly exclaimed Patrick, &lsquo;no doubt
you can gainsay the slander, that our noble King has been caught in
the toils of an artful Englishwoman, and been drawn in to promise her
a share in his crown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A flush of crimson flamed forth on Sir James Stewart&rsquo;s cheeks,
and his tawny eye glanced with a fire like red lightning, but he seemed,
as it were, to be holding himself in, and answered with a voice forcibly
kept low and calm, and therefore the more terribly stern, &lsquo;Young
Sir, I warn you to honour your future queen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir David made a gesture with his hand, enforcing restraint upon
his son, and turning to Sir James, said, &lsquo;Our queen will we honour,
when such she is, Sir; but if you are returning to the King, it were
well that he should know that our hot Scottish bloods, here, could scarce
brook an English alliance, and certainly not one beneath his birth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The King would answer, Sir,&rsquo; returned Sir James, haughtily,
but with recovered command over himself, &lsquo;that it is for him to
judge whom his subjects shall brook as their queen.&nbsp; Moreover,&rsquo;
he added, in a different and more conciliatory voice, &lsquo;Scotsmen
must be proud indeed who disdain the late King&rsquo;s niece, the great-granddaughter
of King Edward III., and as noble and queenly a demoiselle as ever was
born in a palace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is so very fair, then?&rsquo; said Lilies, who was of
course on the side of true love.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have seen her, gentle
Sir?&nbsp; Oh, tell us what are her beauties?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair damsel,&rsquo; said Sir James, in a much more gentle
tone, &lsquo;you forget that I am only a poor prisoner, who have only
now and then viewed the lady Joan Beaufort with distant reverence, as
destined to be my queen.&nbsp; All I can tell is, that her walk and
bearing mark her out for a throne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And oh!&rsquo; cried Malcolm, &lsquo;is it not true that the
King hath composed songs and poems in her honour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pah!&rsquo; muttered Patrick; &lsquo;as though the King would
be no better than a wandering minstrel rhymester!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or than King David!&rsquo; dryly said Sir James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true, then, Sir,&rsquo; exclaimed Lilias.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
doth verily add minstrelsy to his other graces?&nbsp; Know you the lines,
Sir?&nbsp; Can you sing them to us?&nbsp; Oh, I pray you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, fair maid,&rsquo; returned Sir James, &lsquo;methinks
I might but add to the scorn wherewith Sir Patrick is but too much inclined
to regard the captive King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A captive, a captive&mdash;ay, minstrelsy is the right solace
for a captive,&rsquo; said Patrick; &lsquo;at least, so they say and
sing.&nbsp; Our king will have better work when he gains his freedom.&nbsp;
Only there will come before me a subtilty I once saw in jelly and blanc-mange,
at a banquet in France, where a lion fell in love with a hunter&rsquo;s
daughter, and let her, for love&rsquo;s sake, draw his teeth and clip
his claws, whereupon he found himself made a sport for her father&rsquo;s
hounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promise you, Sir Patrick,&rsquo; replied the guest, &lsquo;that
the Lady Joan is more hike to send her Lion forth from the hunter&rsquo;s
toils, with claws and teeth fresh-whetted by the desire of honour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the lay&mdash;the hay, Sir,&rsquo; entreated Lilias; &lsquo;who
knows that it may not win Patrick to be the Lady Joan&rsquo;s devoted
servant?&nbsp; Malcolm, your harp!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm had already gone in quest of the harp he loved all the better
for the discouragement thrown on his gentle tastes.</p>
<p>The knight leant back, with a pensive look softening his features
as he said, after a little consideration, &lsquo;Then, fair lady, I
will sing you the song made by King James, when he had first seen the
fair mistress of his heart, on the slopes of Windsor, looking from his
chamber window.&nbsp; He feigns her to be a nightingale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is that, Sir?&rsquo; demanded Lilias.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have heard the word in romances, and deemed it a kind of angel that
sings by night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a bird, sister,&rsquo; replied Malcolm; &lsquo;Philomel,
that pierces her breast with a thorn, and sings sweetly even to her
death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s mere minstrel leasing, Malcolm,&rsquo; said Patrick.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have both seen and heard the bird in France&mdash;<i>Rossignol</i>,
as we call it there; and were I a lady, I should deem it small compliment
to be likened to a little russet-backed, homely fowl such as that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;While I,&rsquo; replied the prisoner, &lsquo;feel so much
with your fair sister, that nightingales are a sort of angels that sing
by night, that it pains me, when I think of winning my freedom, to remember
that I shall never again hear their songs answering one another through
the forest of Windsor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Patrick shrugged his shoulders, but Lilias was so anxious to hear
the lay, that she entreated him to be silent; and Sir James, with a
manly mellow voice, with an exceedingly sweet strain in it, and a skill,
both of modulation and finger, such as showed admirable taste and instruction,
poured forth that beautiful song of the nightingale at Windsor, which
commences King James&rsquo;s story of his love, in his poem of the King&rsquo;s
Quhair.</p>
<p>There was an eager pressing round to hear, and not only were Lilias
and Malcolm, but old Sir David himself, much affected by the strain,
which the latter said put him in mind of the days of King Robert III.,
which, sad as they were, now seemed like good old times, so much worse
was the present state of affairs.&nbsp; Sir James, however, seemed anxious
to prevent discussion of the verses he had sung, and applied to Malcolm
to give a specimen of his powers: and thus, with music, ballad, and
lay, the evening passed away, till the parting cup was sent round, and
the Tutor of Glenuskie and Malcolm marshalled their guest to the apartment
where he was to sleep, in a wainscoted box bedstead, and his two attendant
squires, a great iron-gray Scot and a rosy honest-faced Englishman,
on pallets on the floor.</p>
<p>In the morning he went on his journey, but not without an invitation
to rest there again on his way back, whether with or without his ransom.&nbsp;
He promised to come, saying that he should gladly bear to the King the
last advices from one so honoured as the Tutor of Glenuskie; and, on
their sides, Malcolm and Sir David resolved to do their best to have
some gold pieces to contribute, rather than so &lsquo;proper a knight&rsquo;
should fail in raising his ransom; but gold was never plenty, and Patrick
needed all that his uncle could supply, to bear him to those wars in
France, where he looked for renown and fortune.</p>
<p>For these were, as may have been gathered, those evil days when James
I. of Scotland was still a captive to England, and when the House of
Albany exercised its cruel misrule upon Scotland; delaying to ransom
the King, lest they should bring home a master.</p>
<p>Old Robert of Albany had been King Stork, his son Murdoch was King
Log; and the misery was infinitely increased by the violence and lawlessness
of Murdoch&rsquo;s sons.&nbsp; King Robert II. had left Scotland the
fearful legacy of, as Froissart says, &lsquo;eleven sons who loved arms.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Of these, Robert III. was the eldest, the Duke of Albany the second.&nbsp;
These were both dead, and were represented, the one by the captive young
King James, the other by the Regent, Duke Murdoch of Albany, and his
brother John, Earl of Buchan, now about to head a Scottish force, among
whom Patrick Drummond intended to sail, to assist the French.</p>
<p>Others of the eleven, Earls of Athol, Menteith, &amp;c., survived;
but the youngest of the brotherhood, by name Malcolm, who had married
the heiress of Glenuskie, had been killed at Homildon Hill, when he
had solemnly charged his Stewart nephews and brothers to leave his two
orphan children to the sole charge of their mother&rsquo;s cousin, Sir
David Drummond, a good old man, who had been the best supporter and
confidant of poor Robert III. in his unhappy reign, and in embassies
to France had lost much of the rugged barbarism to which Scotland had
retrograded during the wars with England.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II: THE RESCUE OF COLDINGHAM</h2>
<p>It was a lonely tract of road, marked only by the bare space trodden
by feet of man and horse, and yet, in truth, the highway between Berwick
and Edinburgh, which descended from a heathery moorland into a somewhat
spacious valley, with copsewood clothing one side, in the midst of which
rose a high mound or knoll, probably once the site of a camp, for it
still bore lines of circumvallation, although it was entirely deserted,
except by the wandering shepherds of the neighbourhood, or occasionally
by outlaws, who found an admirable ambush in the rear.</p>
<p>The spring had hung the hazels with tassels, bedecked the willows
with golden downy tufts, and opened the primroses and celandines beneath
them, when the solitary dale was disturbed by the hasty clatter of horses&rsquo;
feet, and hard, heavy breathing as of those who had galloped headlong
beyond their strength.&nbsp; Here, however, the foremost of the party,
an old esquire, who grasped the bridle-rein of youth by his side, drew
up his own horse, and that which he was dragging on with him, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We may breathe here a moment; there is shelter in the wood.&nbsp;
And you, Rab, get ye up to the top of Jill&rsquo;s Knowe, and keep a
good look-out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me go back, you false villain!&rsquo; sobbed the boy,
with the first use of his recovered breath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not be so daft, Lord Malcolm,&rsquo; replied the Squire,
retaining his hold on the boy&rsquo;s bridle; &lsquo;what, rin your
head into the wolf&rsquo;s mouth again, when we&rsquo;ve barely brought
you off haill and sain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Haill and sain?&nbsp; Dastard and forlorn,&rsquo; cried Malcolm,
with passionate weeping.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&mdash;I to flee and leave my
sister&mdash;my uncle!&nbsp; Oh, where are they?&nbsp; Halbert, let
me go; I&rsquo;ll never pardon thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hoot, my lord! would I let you gang, when the Tutor spak to
me as plain as I hear you now?&nbsp; &ldquo;Take off Lord Malcolm,&rdquo;
says he; &ldquo;save him, and you save the rest.&nbsp; See him safe
to the Earl of Mar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those were his words, my lord; and
if you wilna heed them, I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, and leave my sister to the reivers?&nbsp; Oh, what may
not they be doing to her?&nbsp; Let us go back and fall on them, Halbert;
better die saving her than know her in Walter Stewart&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
Then were I the wretched craven he calls me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look you, Lord Malcolm,&rsquo; said Halbert, laying his finger
on his nose, with a knowing expression, &lsquo;my young lady is safe
from harm so long as you are out of the Master of Albany&rsquo;s reach.&nbsp;
Had you come by a canny thrust in the fray, as no doubt was his purpose,
or were you in his hands to be mewed in a convent, then were your sister
worth the wedding; but the Master will never wed her while you live
and have friends to back you, and his father, the Regent, will see she
has no ill-usage.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll do best for yourself and her too,
as well as Sir David, if you make for Dunbar, and call ben your uncles
of Athole and Strathern.&mdash;How now, Rab? are the loons making this
way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Na, na!&rsquo; said Rab, descending; &lsquo;&rsquo;tis from
the other gate; &rsquo;tis a knight in blue damasked steel: he, methinks,
that harboured in our castle some weeks syne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hm!&rsquo; said Halbert, considering; &lsquo;he looked like
a trusty cheild: maybe he&rsquo;d guide my lord here to a wiser wit,
and a good lance on the way to Dunbar is not to be scorned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In fact, there would have been no time for one party to conceal themselves
from the other; for, hidden by the copsewood, and unheeded by the watchers
who were gazing in the opposite direction, Sir James Stewart and his
two attendants suddenly came round the foot of Jill&rsquo;s Knowe upon
the fugitives, who were profiting by the interval to loosen the girths
of their horses, and water them at the pool under the thicket, whilst
Halbert in vain tried to pacify and reason with the young master, who
had thrown himself on the grass in an agony of grief and despair.&nbsp;
Sir James, after the first momentary start, recognized the party in
an instant, and at once leapt from his horse, exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How now, my bonnie man&mdash;my kind host&mdash;what is it?
what makes this grief?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not speak to me, Sir,&rsquo; muttered the unhappy boy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They have been reft&mdash;reft from me, and I have done nothing
for them.&nbsp; Walter of Albany has them, and I am here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he gave way to another paroxysm of grief, while Halbert explained
to Sir James Stewart that when Sir Patrick Drummond had gone to embark
for France, with the army led to the aid of Charles VI. by the Earl
of Buchan, his father and cousins, with a large escort, had accompanied
him to Eyemouth; whence, after taking leave of him, they had set out
to spend Passion-tide and Easter at Coldingham Abbey, after the frequent
fashion of the devoutly inclined among the Scottish nobility, in whose
castles there was often little commodity for religious observances.&nbsp;
Short, however, as was the distance, they had in the midst of it been
suddenly assailed by a band of armed men, among whom might easily be
recognized the giant form of young Walter Stewart, the Master of Albany,
the Regent Duke Murdoch&rsquo;s eldest son, who was well known for his
lawless excesses and violence.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s silky sayings,
and his own ruder speeches, had long made it known to the House of Glenuskie
that the family policy was to cajole or to drive the sickly heir into
a convent, and, rendering Lilias the possessor of the broad lands inherited
from both parents, unite her and them to the Albany family.</p>
<p>The almost barbarous fierceness and wild licentiousness of Walter
would have made the arrangement abhorrent to Lilias, even had not love
passages already passed between her and her cousin, Patrick Drummond,
and Sir David had hitherto protected her by keeping Malcolm in the secular
life; but Walter, it seemed, had grown impatient, and had made this
treacherous attack, evidently hoping to rid himself of the brother,
and secure the sister.&nbsp; No sooner had the Tutor of Glenuskie perceived
that his own party were overmatched, than he had bidden his faithful
squire to secure the bairns&mdash;if not both, at least the boy; and
Halbert, perceiving that Lilias had already been pounced upon by Sir
Walter himself and several more, seized the bridle of the bewildered
Malcolm, who was still trying to draw his sword, and had absolutely
swept him away from the scene of action before he had well realized
what was passing; and now that the poor lad understood the whole, his
horror, grief, and shame were unspeakable.</p>
<p>Before Sir James had done more than hear the outline of Halbert&rsquo;s
tale, however, the watchers on the mound gave the signal that the reivers
were coming that way&mdash;a matter hitherto doubtful, since no one
could guess whether Walter Stewart would make for Edinburgh or for Doune.&nbsp;
With the utmost agility Sir James sprang up the side of the mound, reconnoitred,
and returned again just as Halbert was trying to stir his master from
the ground, and Malcolm answering sullenly that he would not move&mdash;he
would be taken and die with the rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may save them instead, if you will attend to me,&rsquo;
said Sir James; and at his words the boy suddenly started up with a
look of hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many fell upon you?&rsquo; demanded Sir James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Full a hundred lances,&rsquo; replied Halbert (and a lance
meant at least three men).&nbsp; &lsquo;It wad be a fule&rsquo;s wark
to withstand them.&nbsp; Best bide fast in the covert, for our horses
are sair forfaughten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there are now more than twenty lances, I am greatly mistaken,&rsquo;
returned Sir James.&nbsp; &lsquo;They must have broken up after striking
their blow, or have sent to secure Glenuskie; and we, falling on them
from this thicket&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see, I see,&rsquo; cried Halbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Back, ye
loons; back among the hazels.&nbsp; Hold every one his horse ready to
mount.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With your favour, Sir Squire, I say, bind each man his horse
to a tree.&nbsp; The skene and broadsword, which I see you all wear,
will be ten times as effective on foot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do as the knight bids,&rsquo; said Malcolm, starting forth
with colour on his cheek, light in his eye, that made him another being.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In him there is help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, Lord Malcolm,&rsquo; muttered Halbert; &lsquo;you
need not tell me that: I know my duty better than not to do the bidding
of a belted knight, and pretty man too of his inches.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two attendants of Sir James were meantime apparently uttering
some remonstrance, to which he lightly replied, &lsquo;Tut, Nigel; it
will do thine heart good to hew down a minion of Albany.&nbsp; What
were I worth could I not strike a blow against so foul a wrong to my
own orphan kindred?&nbsp; Brewster, I&rsquo;ll answer it to thy master.&nbsp;
These are his foes, as well as those of all honest men.&nbsp; Ha! thou
art as glad to be at them as I myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time he had exchanged his cap for a steel helmet, and was
assuming the command as his natural right, as he placed the men in their
ambush behind the knoll, received reports from those he had set to watch,
and concerted the signal with Halbert and his own followers.&nbsp; Malcolm
kept by him, shivering with intense excitement and eagerness; and thus
they waited till the horses&rsquo; hoofs and clank of armour were distinctly
audible.&nbsp; But even then Sir James, with outstretched hand, signed
his followers back, and kept them in the leash, as it were, until the
troop was fairly in the valley, those in front beginning to halt to
give their horses water.&nbsp; They were, in effect, riding somewhat
carelessly, and with the ease of men whose feat was performed, and who
expected no more opposition.&nbsp; Full in the midst was Lilias, entirely
muffled and pinioned by a large plaid drawn closely round her, and held
upon the front of the saddle of a large tall horse, ridden by a slender,
light-limbed, wiry groom, whom Malcolm knew as Christopher Hall, a retainer
of the Duke of Albany; and beside him rode her captor, Sir Walter Stewart,
a man little above twenty, but with a bronzed, hardened, reckless expression
that made him look much older, and of huge height and giant build.&nbsp;
Malcolm knew him well, and regarded him with unmitigated horror and
dread, both from the knowledge of his ruffianly violence even towards
his father, from fear of his intentions, and from the misery that his
brutal jests, scoffs, and practical jokes had often personally inflicted:
and the sight of his sister in the power of this wicked man was the
realization of all his worst fears.&nbsp; But ere there was time for
more than one strong pang of consternation and constitutional terror,
Sir James&rsquo;s shout of &lsquo;St. Andrew for the right!&rsquo; was
ringing out, echoed by all the fifteen in ambush with him, as simultaneously
they leapt forward.&nbsp; Malcolm, among the first, darting with one
spring, as it were, to the horse where his sister was carried, seized
the bridle with his left hand, and flashing his sword upon the ruffian
with the other, shouted, &lsquo;Let go, villain; give me my sister!&rsquo;
Hall&rsquo;s first impulse was to push his horse forward so as to trample
the boy down, but Malcolm&rsquo;s hold rendered this impossible; besides,
there was the shouting, the clang, the confusion of the outburst of
an ambush all around and on every side, and before the man could free
his hand to draw his weapon he necessarily loosed his grasp of Lilias,
who, half springing, half falling, came to the ground, almost overthrowing
her brother in her descent, but just saved by him from coming down prostrate.&nbsp;
The horse, suddenly released, started forward with its rider and at
the same moment Malcolm, recovering himself, stood with his sword in
his hand, his arm round his sister&rsquo;s waist, assuring her that
she was safe, and himself glowing for the first time with manly exultation.&nbsp;
Had he not saved and rescued her himself?</p>
<p>It was as well, however, that the rescue did not depend on his sole
prowess.&nbsp; Indeed, by the time the brother and sister were clinging
together and turning to look round, the first shock was over, and the
retainers of Albany, probably fancying the attack made by a much larger
troop, were either in full flight, or getting decidedly the worst in
their encounters with their assailants.</p>
<p>Sir James Stewart had at the first onset sprung like a lion upon
the Master of Albany, and without drawing his sword had grappled with
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the name of St. Andrew and the King, yield thy
prey, thou dastard,&rsquo; were his words as he threw his arms round
the body of Sir Walter, and exerted his full strength to drag him from
his horse.&nbsp; The young giant writhed, struggled, cursed, raged;
he had not space to draw sword or even dagger, but he struck furiously
with his gauntleted hand, strove to drive his horse forward.&nbsp; The
struggle like that of Hercules and Ant&aelig;us, so desperate and mighty
was the strength put forth on either side, but nothing could unclasp
the iron grip of those sinewy arms, and almost as soon as Malcolm and
Lilias had eyes to see what was passing, Walter Stewart was being dragged
off his horse by that tremendous grapple, and the next moment his armour
rung as he lay prostrate on his back upon the ground.</p>
<p>His conqueror set his mailed foot upon his neck lightly, but so as
to prevent any attempt to rise, and after one moment&rsquo;s pause to
gather breath, said in a clear deep trumpet voice, &lsquo;Walter Stewart
of Albany, on one condition I grant thee thy life.&nbsp; It is that
thou take the most solemn oath on the spot that no spulzie or private
brawl shall henceforth stain that hand of thine while thy father holds
the power in Scotland.&nbsp; Take that oath, thou livest: refuse it,
and&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He held up the deadly little dagger called the
misericorde.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who art thou, caitiff land-louper,&rsquo; muttered Walter,
&lsquo;to put to oath knights and princes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The knight raised the visor of his helmet.&nbsp; The evening sun
shone resplendently on his damasked blue armour and the St. Andrew&rsquo;s
cross on his breast, and lighted up that red fire that lurked in his
eyes, and withal the calm power and righteous indignation on his features
might have befitted an avenging angel wielding the lightning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou wilt know me when we meet again,&rsquo; was all he said;
and for the very calmness of the voice the Master of Albany, who was
but a mere commonplace insolent ruffian, quailed with awe and terror
to the very backbone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Loose me, and I will swear,&rsquo; he faintly murmured.</p>
<p>Sir James, before removing his foot, unclasped his gorget, and undoing
a chain, held up a jewel shaped like a St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross, with
a diamond in the midst, covering a fragmentary relic.&nbsp; At the sight
Walter Stewart&rsquo;s eyes, large pale ones, dilated as if with increased
consternation, the sweat started on his forehead, and his breath came
in shorter gasps.&nbsp; Malcolm and Lilias, standing near, likewise
felt a sense of strange awe, for they too had heard of this relic, a
supposed fragment of St. Andrew&rsquo;s own instrument of martyrdom,
which had belonged to St. Margaret, and had been thought a palladium
to the royal family and House of Stewart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rise on thy knees,&rsquo; said Sir James, now taking away
his foot, &lsquo;and swear upon this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Walter, completely cowed and overawed, rose to his knees at his victor&rsquo;s
command, laid his hand on the relic, and in a shaken, almost tremulous
voice, repeated the words of the oath after his dictation: &lsquo;I,
Walter Stewart, Master of Albany, hereby swear to God and St. Andrew,
to fight in no private brawl, to spoil no man nor woman, to oppress
no poor man, clerk, widow, maid, or orphan, to abstain from all wrong
or spulzie from this hour until the King shall come again in peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He uttered the words, and kissed the jewel that was tendered to him;
and then Sir James said, in the same cold and dignified tone, &lsquo;Let
thine oath be sacred, or beware.&nbsp; Now, mount and go thy way, but
take heed <i>how</i> I meet thee again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Walter&rsquo;s horse was held for him by Brewster, the knight&rsquo;s
English attendant, and without another word he flung himself into the
saddle, and rode away to join such of his followers as were waiting
dispersed at a safe distance to mark his fate, but without attempting
anything for his assistance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Sir!&rsquo; burst forth Malcolm; but then, even as he
was about to utter his thanks, his eye sought for the guardian who had
ever been his mouthpiece, and, with a sudden shriek of dismay, he cried,
&lsquo;My uncle! where is he? where is Sir David?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alack! alack!&rsquo; cried Lilias.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, brother,
I saw him on the ground; he fell before my horse.&nbsp; I saw no more,
for the Master held me, and muffled my face.&nbsp; Oh, let us back,
he may yet live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, let us back,&rsquo; said Sir James, &lsquo;if we may
yet save the good old man.&nbsp; Those villains will not dare to follow;
or if they do, Nigel&mdash;Brewster, you understand guarding the rear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; began Lilias, &lsquo;how can we thank&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, lady,&rsquo; replied Sir James, smiling; &lsquo;you
will do better to take your seat; I fear it must be <i>en croupe</i>,
for we can scarce dismount one of your guards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She shall ride behind me,&rsquo; said Malcolm, in a more alert
and confident voice than had ever been heard from him before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, right,&rsquo; said Sir James, placing a kind hand on his
shoulder; &lsquo;thou hast won her back by thine own exploit, and mayst
well have the keeping of her.&nbsp; That rush on the caitiff groom was
well and shrewdly done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And for all Malcolm&rsquo;s anxiety for his uncle, his heart had
never given such a leap as at finding himself suddenly raised from the
depressed down-trodden coward into something like manhood and self-respect.</p>
<p>Lilias, who, like most damsels of her time, was hardy and active,
saw no difficulties in the mode of conveyance, and, so soon as Malcolm
had seated himself on horseback, she placed one foot upon his toe, and
with a spring of her own, assisted by Sir James&rsquo;s well-practised
hand, was instantly perched on the crupper, clasping her brother round
the waist with her arms, and laying her head on his shoulder in loving
pride at his exploit, while for her further security Sir James threw
round them both the long plaid that had so lately bound her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Malcolm&rsquo;&mdash;and her whisper fell sweetly on
his ear&mdash;&lsquo;it will be bonnie tidings for Patie that thou didst
loose me all thyself.&nbsp; The false tyrant, to fall on us the very
hour Patie was on the salt sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But they were riding so fast that there was scant possibility for
words; and, besides, Sir James kept too close to them for private whispers.&nbsp;
In about an hour&rsquo;s time they had crossed the bit of table-land
that formed the moor, and descended into another little gorge, which
was the place where the attack had been made upon the travellers.</p>
<p>This was where it was possible that they might find Sir David; but
no trace was to be seen, except that the grass was trampled and stained
with blood.&nbsp; Perhaps, both Lilias and old Halbert suggested, some
of their people had returned and taken him to the Abbey of Coldingham,
and as this was by far the safest lodging and refuge for her and her
brother, the horses&rsquo; heads were at once turned thitherwards.</p>
<p>The grand old Priory of Coldingham, founded by King Edgar, son of
Margaret the Saint, and of Malcolm Ceanmohr, in testimony of his gratitude
for his recovery of his father&rsquo;s throne from the usurper Donaldbane,
was a Benedictine monastery under the dominion of the great central
Abbey of Durham.</p>
<p>It had been a great favourite with the Scottish kings of that glorious
dynasty which sprung from Margaret of Wessex, and had ample estates,
which, when it was in good hands, enabled it to supply the manifold
purposes of an ecclesiastical school, a model farm, a harbour for travellers,
and a fortified castle.&nbsp; At this period, the Prior, John de Akecliff,
or Oakcliff, was an excellent man, a great friend of Sir David Drummond,
and much disliked and persecuted by the House of Albany, so that there
was little doubt that this would be the first refuge thought of by Sir
David&rsquo;s followers.</p>
<p>Accordingly Malcolm and his companions rode up to the chief gateway,
a grand circular archway, with all the noble though grotesque mouldings,
zigzag and cable, dog-tooth and parrot-beak, visages human and diabolic,
wherewith the Norman builders loved to surround their doorways.&nbsp;
The doors were of solid oak, heavily guarded with iron, and from a little
wicket in the midst peered out a cowled head, and instantly ensued the
exclamation&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Benedicite!&nbsp; Welcome, my Lord Malcolm!&nbsp; Ah! but
this will ease the heart of the Tutor of Glenuskie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! then he is here?&rsquo; cried Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, Sir, but in woful plight; borne in an hour syne by four
carles who said you had been set upon by the Master of Albany, and sair
harried, and they say the Tutor doth nought but wail for his bairns.&nbsp;
How won ye out of his hands, my Lord?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks to this good knight,&rsquo; said Malcolm; and the gate
was opened, and the new-comers dismounted to pass under the archway,
which taught humility.&nbsp; A number of the brethren met them as they
came forth into the first quadrangle, surrounded by a beautiful cloister,
and containing what was called Edgar&rsquo;s Walls, a house raised by
the good founder, for his own lodging and that of visitors, within the
monastery.&nbsp; It was a narrow building, about thirty feet from the
church, was perfectly familiar to Malcolm, who bent his steps at once
thither, among the congratulations of the monks; and Lilias was not
prevented from accompanying him thus far within the convent, but all
beyond the nave of the church was forbidden ground to her sex, though
the original monastery destroyed by the Danes had been one of the double
foundations for monks and nuns.</p>
<p>Entering the building, the brother and sister hastily crossed a sort
of outer hall to a chamber where Sir David lay on his bed, attended
by the Prior Akecliff and the Infirmarer.&nbsp; The glad tidings had
already reached him, and he held out his hands, kissed and blessed his
restored charges, and gave thanks with all his heart; but there was
a strange wanness upon his face, and a spasm of severe pain crossed
him more than once, though, as Lilias eagerly asked after his hurts,
he called them nothing, since he had her safe again, and then bade Malcolm
summon the captive knight that he might thank him.</p>
<p>Sir James Stewart had been left in the hall without, to the hospitality
of the monks; he had laid aside his helmet, washed his face, and arranged
his bright locks, and as he rose to follow Malcolm, his majestic stature
and bearing seemed to befit the home of the old Scottish King.</p>
<p>As he entered the chamber, Sir David slightly raised himself on the
pillow, and, with his eyes dilating into a bewildered gaze, exclaimed,
&lsquo;My liege, my dear master!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He raves,&rsquo; sighed Lilias, clasping Malcolm&rsquo;s hand
in dire distress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; muttered the sick man, sinking back.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good
King Robert has been in his grave many a day; his sons, woe is me!&mdash;Sir,&rsquo;
recovering himself, &lsquo;pardon the error of an old dying man, who
owes you more than he can express.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, Sir,&rsquo; said James Stewart, &lsquo;grant me the
favour of a few moments&rsquo; private speech with you.&nbsp; I will
not keep you long from him,&rsquo; he added to Malcolm and Lilias.</p>
<p>His manner was never one to be disputed, there was an atmosphere
of obedience about the whole monastery, and the Prior added&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my children, it is but fitting that you should give thanks
in the church for your unlooked-for deliverance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm was forced to lead Lilias away into the exquisite cross church,
built in the loveliest Early English style, of which a few graceful
remnants still exist.&nbsp; The two young things knelt together hand
in hand in the lornness of their approaching desolation, neither of
them having dared to utter the foreboding upon their hearts, but feeling
it all the more surely; and while the sister&rsquo;s spirit longed fervently
after him whose protection had been only just removed, the brother looked
up to the sheltering vaults, lost in the tranquil twilight, and felt
that here alone was his haven of peace, the refuge for the feeble and
the fatherless.</p>
<p>Their devotions performed, they ventured back to the outer hall,
and on their return being notified, they were again admitted.&nbsp;
Sir James, who had been seated on a stool by the sick man&rsquo;s head,
immediately rose and resigned his place to Lilias, but did not leave
the room and Sir David thus spoke: &lsquo;Bairns, God in His mercy hath
raised you up the best of guardians in the stead of your ain poor Tutor.&nbsp;
Malcolm, laddie, you will ride the morn with this gentleman to the true
head of your name, your ain King, whom God for ever bless!&rsquo;&nbsp;
His voice quivered.&nbsp; &lsquo;And be it your study so to profit by
his example and nurture, as to do your devoir by him for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, father,&rsquo; cried Malcolm, &lsquo;I cannot leave you
and Lily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you call me father, do my bidding,&rsquo; said Sir David.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lily can be safely bestowed with the good Sisters of St. Abbs,
nor while you are out of Albany&rsquo;s reach is the poor lassie worth
his molesting; but when I am gone, your uncles of Albany and Athole
become your tutors, and the Prior has no power to save you.&nbsp; Only
over the Border with the King is there safety from them, and your ruin
is the ruin of your sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; added Sir James, &lsquo;when the King is at liberty,
or when you yourself are of age, you will return to resume the charge
of your fair sister, unless some nearer protector be found.&nbsp; Meantime,&rsquo;
he laid one hand on Malcolm&rsquo;s head, and with the other took out
the relic which had had so great an effect upon Walter Stewart, &lsquo;I
swear on this holy Rood of St. Andrew, that Malcolm Stewart of Glenuskie
shall be my charge, not merely as my kinsman, but as my young brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You hear, Malcolm,&rsquo; said Sir David.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
will strive to merit such goodness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; broke out the poor boy again, &lsquo;you cannot
mean to part us!&nbsp; Let us abide as we have been till I am of age
to take my vows!&nbsp; I am not fit to serve the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is the best judge of that,&rsquo; returned Sir James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; added Sir David, &lsquo;I tell you, lad, that
I shall never be as I was before, and that were I a whole man and sain,
riding back to Glenuskie the morn, I should still bless the saints and
bid you gang.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rarely did the youth of the fifteenth century venture to question
the authority of an elder, but Malcolm was only silenced for a moment,
and though by no means understanding that his guardian believed his
injuries mortal, he threw himself upon the advice of the Prior, whom
he entreated to allow him to judge for himself, and to remain to protect
his sister&mdash;he talked boldly of protecting her after this day&rsquo;s
exploit.&nbsp; But Prior Akecliff gave him no more encouragement than
did his uncle.&nbsp; The Benedictine vows were out of the question till
he should be eighteen, and the renunciation of the world they involved
would be ruinous to Lilias, since she would become his heiress.&nbsp;
Moreover, the Prior himself was almost in a state of siege, for the
Regent was endeavouring to intrude on the convent one Brother William
Drake, or Drax, by his own nomination, instead of the canonical appointment
emanating from Durham, and as national feeling went with the Regent&rsquo;s
nominee, it was by no means certain that the present Prior would be
able to maintain his position.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, go! yes, go, dear brother,&rsquo; entreated Lilias.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I should be far happier to know you in safety.&nbsp; They cannot
hurt me while you are safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you, Lily!&nbsp; What if this villain Drax have his way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He could not harm her in St. Ebba&rsquo;s fold,&rsquo; returned
the Prior.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Abbess herself could not yield her; and,
as you have so often been told, my young Lord, your absence is a far
greater protection to your sister than your presence.&nbsp; Moreover,
were the Tutor&rsquo;s mind at rest, there would be far better hope
of his recovery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no alternative, and Malcolm could not but submit.&nbsp;
Lilias was to be conducted before daybreak to the monastery of St. Abbs,
about six miles off, whence she could be summoned at any time to be
with her uncle in Coldingham; and Malcolm was to set off at daybreak
with the captive knight, whose return to England could no longer be
delayed.</p>
<p>Poor children! while Sir James Stewart was in the Prior&rsquo;s chamber,
they sat silent and mournful by the bedside where their guardian lay
dozing, even till the bell for Matins summoned them in common with all
the other inmates of the convent; they knelt on the floor of the candle-lit
church, and held each other&rsquo;s hands as they prayed; Lilias still
the stronger and more hopeful, while Malcolm, as he looked up at those
dear familiar vaultings, felt as if he were a bird driven from its calm
peaceful nest to battle with the tossing winds and storms of ocean,
without one near him whom he had learnt to love.</p>
<p>It was still dark when the service had ended, and Prior Akecliff
came towards them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Daughter,&rsquo; he said to Lilias,
&lsquo;we deem it safer that you should ride to St. Abbs ere daylight.&nbsp;
Your palfrey is ready, the Mother Abbess is warned, and I will myself
conduct you thither.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Priors were not people to be kept waiting, and as it was reported
that the Tutor of Glenuskie was still asleep, Lilias had to depart without
taking leave of him.&nbsp; With Malcolm the last words were spoken while
crossing the court.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fear not, Lily; my heart will only
weary till the Church owns me, and Patie has you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, my Malcolm; mayhap, as the Prior tells me, your strength
and manhood will come in the south country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let them,&rsquo; said Malcolm; &lsquo;I will neither cheat
the Church nor Patie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It were no cheat.&nbsp; There never was any compact.&nbsp;
Patie is winning his fortune by his own sword; he would scorn&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, Lily!&nbsp; When the King sees what a weakling Sir James
has brought him, he will be but too glad to exchange Patie for me, and
leave me safe in these blessed walls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But here they were under the archway, and the convoy of armed men,
whom the exigencies of the time forced the convent to maintain, were
already mounted.&nbsp; Sir James stood ready to assist the lady to her
saddle, and with one long earnest embrace the brother and sister were
parted, and Lilias rode away with the Prior by her side, letting the
tears flow quietly down her cheeks in the darkness, and but half hearing
the long arguments by which good Father Akecliff was proving to her
that the decision was the best for both Malcolm and herself.</p>
<p>By and by the dawn began to appear, the air of the March night became
sharper, and in the distance the murmur and plash of the tide was heard.&nbsp;
Then, standing heavy and dark against the clear pale eastern sky, there
arose the dark mass of St. Ebba&rsquo;s monastery, the parent of Coldingham,
standing on the very verge of the cliff to which it has left the name
of St. Abb&rsquo;s Head, upon ground which has since been undermined
by the waves, and has been devoured by them.&nbsp; The sea, far below,
calmly brightened with the brightening sky, and reflected the morning
stars in a lucid track of light, strong enough to make the lights glisten
red in the convent windows.&nbsp; Lilias was expected, was a frequent
guest, and had many friends there, and as the sweet sound of the Lauds
came from the chapel, and while she dismounted in the court the concluding
&lsquo;Amen&rsquo; swelled and died away, she, though no convent bird,
felt herself in a safe home and shelter under the wing of kind Abbess
Annabel Drummond, and only mourned that Malcolm, so much tenderer and
more shrinking than herself, should be driven into the unknown world
that he dreaded so much more than she did.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III: HAL</h2>
<p>The sun had not long been shining on the dark walls of St. Ebba&rsquo;s
monastery, before the low-browed gate of Coldingham Priory opened to
let pass the guests of the previous night.&nbsp; Malcolm had been kissed
and blessed by his guardian, and bidden to transfer his dutiful obedience
to his new protector; and somewhat comforted by believing Sir David
to be mending since last night, he had rent himself away, and was riding
in the frosty morning air beside the kinsman who had so strangely taken
charge of him, and accompanied by Sir James&rsquo;s tall old Scottish
squire, by the English groom, and by Malcolm&rsquo;s own servant, Halbert.</p>
<p>For a long space there was perfect silence: and as Malcolm began
to detach his thoughts from all that he had left behind, he could not
help being struck with the expressions that flitted over his companion&rsquo;s
countenance.&nbsp; For a time he would seem lost in some deep mournful
reverie, and his head drooped as if in sadness or perplexity; then a
sudden gleam would light up his face, as if a brilliant project had
occurred to him, his lips would part, his eyes flash, he would impel
his horse forward as though leading a charge, or lift up his head with
kindling looks, like one rehearsing a speech; but ever a check would
come on him in the midst, his mouth closed in dejection, his brow drew
together in an anguish of impatience, his eyelids drooped in weariness,
and he would ride on in deep reflection, till roused perhaps by the
flight of a moor-fowl, or the rush of a startled roe, he would hum some
gay French hunting-song or plaintive Scottish ballad.</p>
<p>Scarcely a word had been uttered, until towards noon, on the borders
of a little narrow valley, the merry sound of bells clashed up to their
ears, and therewith sounds of music.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the toon
of Christ&rsquo;s Kirk on the Green,&rsquo; said the squire, as Sir
James looked at him for information, &lsquo;where we were to bait.&nbsp;
Methought in Lent we had been spared this gallimawfrey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis Midlent week, you pagan,&rsquo; replied Sir James.&nbsp;
&lsquo;These good folk have come a-mothering, and a share of their simnels
we&rsquo;ll have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; entreated the squire, &lsquo;were it not more
prudent of you to tarry without, and let me fetch provisions?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hoot, man, a throng is our best friend!&nbsp; Besides, the
horses must rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Sir James rode eagerly forward; Malcolm following, not
without wonder at not having been consulted, for though kept in strict
discipline by his uncle, it had always been with every courtesy due
to his rank as a king&rsquo;s grandson; and the cousins, from whom he
had suffered, were of the same rank with himself.&nbsp; Did this wandering
landless knight, now he had him in his power, mean to disregard all
that was his due?&nbsp; But when Sir James turned round his face sparkling
with good-humour and amusement, and laughed as he said, &lsquo;Now then
for the humours of a Scottish fair!&rsquo; all his offended dignity
was forgotten.</p>
<p>The greensward was surrounded by small huts and hovels; a little
old stone church on one side, and a hostel near it, shadowed by a single
tall elm, beneath which was the very centre of the village wake.&nbsp;
Not only was it Midlent, but the day was the feast of a local saint,
in whose honour Lenten requirements were relaxed.&nbsp; Monks and priests
were there in plenty, and so were jugglers and maskers, Robin Hood and
Marion, glee-men and harpers, merchants and hucksters, masterful beggars
and sorners, shepherds in gray mauds with wise collies at their feet,
shrewd old carlines with their winter&rsquo;s spinning of yarn, lean
wolf-like borderers peaceable for the nonce, merry lasses with tow-like
locks floating from their snoods, all seen by the intensely glittering
sun of a clear March day, dry and not too cold for these hardy northern
folk.</p>
<p>Nigel, the squire, sighed in despondency; and Malcolm, who hated
crowds, and knew himself a mark for the rude observations of a free-spoken
populace, shrank up to him, when Sir James, nodding in time to the tones
of a bagpipe that was playing at the hostel door, flung his bridle to
Brewster the groom, laughed at his glum and contemptuous looks, merrily
hailed the gudewife with her brown face and big silver ear-rings, seated
himself on the bench at the long wooden table under the great garland
of fir-boughs, willow catkins, and primroses, hung over the boughs of
the tree, crossed himself, murmured his <i>Benedictus benedicat</i>,
drew his dagger, carved a slice of the haunch of ox on the table, offered
it to the reluctant Malcolm, then helping himself, entered into conversation
with the lean friar on one side of him, and the stalwart man-at-arms
opposite, apparently as indifferent as the rest of the company to the
fact that the uncovered boards of the table were the only trenchers,
and the salt and mustard were taken by the point of each man&rsquo;s
dagger from common receptacles dispersed along the board.&nbsp; Probably
the only person really disgusted or amazed was the English Brewster,
who, though too cautious to express a word of his feelings, preserved
the most complete silence, and could scarcely persuade himself to taste
the rude fare.</p>
<p>Nor when the meal was over was Sir James disposed to heed the wistful
looks of his attendants, but wandered off to watch the contest in archery
at the butts, where arrow after arrow flew wide of the clout, for the
strength of Scotland did not lie in the long-bow, and Albany&rsquo;s
edict that shooting should be practised on Sundays and holidays had
not produced as yet any great dexterity.</p>
<p>Sir James at first laughed merrily at the extraordinary screwings
of visage and contortions of attitude, and the useless demonstration
of effort with which the clowns aimed their shafts and drew their bow,
sometimes to find the arrow on the grass at their feet, sometimes to
see it producing consternation among the bystanders; but when he saw
Brewster standing silently apart, viewing their efforts with a scorn
visible enough in the dead stolidity of his countenance, he murmured
a bitter interjection, and turned away with folded arms and frowning
brow.</p>
<p>Nigel again urged their departure, but at that moment the sweet notes
of a long narrative ballad began to sound to the accompaniment of a
harp, and he stood motionless while the wild mournful ditty told of
the cruelty of the Lady of Frendraught, and how</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Morning sun ne&rsquo;er shone upon<br />
Lord John and Rothiemay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Large tears were dropping from under the hand with he veiled his
emotion; and when Nigel touched his cloak to remind him that the horses
were ready, he pressed the old man&rsquo;s hand, saying, with a sigh,
&lsquo;I heard that last at my father&rsquo;s knee!&nbsp; It rung in
my ears for many a year!&nbsp; Here, lad!&rsquo; and dropping a gold
coin into the wooden bowl carried round by the blind minstrel&rsquo;s
attendant, he was turning away, when the glee-man, detecting perhaps
the ring of the coin, broke forth in stirring tones&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It fell about the Lammas tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When moormen win their hay,<br />
The doughty Earl of Douglas rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into England to catch a prey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he stood transfixed, beating time with his hand, his eyes beaming,
his hips moving as he followed the spirit-stirring ballad; and then,
as Douglas falls, and is laid beneath the bracken bush, unseen by his
men, and Montgomery forces Hotspur to yield, not to him, but</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;to the bracken
bush<br />
That grows upon the lily lea,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he sobbed without disguise; and no sooner was the ballad ended than
he sprang forward to the harper, crying, &lsquo;Again, again; another
gold crown to hear it again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; entreated Nigel, &lsquo;remember how much hangs
on your speed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ballad I <i>must</i> have,&rsquo; exclaimed Sir James,
trying to shake him off.&nbsp; &lsquo;It moves the heart more than aught
I ever heard!&nbsp; How runs it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> know the ballad,&rsquo; said Malcolm, half in impatience,
half in contempt.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could sing every word of it.&nbsp;
Every glee-man has it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay&mdash;hear you, Sir&mdash;the lad can sing it,&rsquo;
reiterated Nigel; and Sir James, throwing the promised guerdon to the
minstrel, let himself be led away to the front of the inn; but there
was a piper, playing to a group of dancers, and as if his feet could
not resist the fascination, Sir James held out his hand to the first
comely lass he saw disengaged, and in spite of the steel-guarded boots
that he wore, answered foot for foot, spring for spring, to the deft
manoeuvres of her shoeless feet, with equal agility and greater grace.&nbsp;
Nigel frowned more than ever at this exhibition, and when the knight
had led his panting partner to a seat, and called for a tankard of ale
for her refreshment, he remonstrated more seriously still.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,
the gates of Berwick will be shut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The days lengthen, man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who knows if some of yon land-loupers be not of Walter
Stewart&rsquo;s mein&eacute;?&nbsp; Granted that they ken not yourself,
that lad is only too ken-speckle.&nbsp; Moreover, you ye made free enough
with your siller to set the haill crew of moss-troopers on our track.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty mile to Berwick-gate,&rsquo; said Sir James, carelessly;
&lsquo;nor need you ever look behind you at jades like theirs.&nbsp;
Nay, friend, I come, since you grudge me for once the sight of a little
wholesome glee among my own people.&nbsp; My holiday is dropping from
me like sands in an hour-glass!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He mounted, however, and put his horse to as round a pace as could
be maintained by the whole party with out distress; nor did he again
break silence for many miles.</p>
<p>At the gates of Berwick, then in English hands, be gave a pass-word,
and was admitted, he bade Nigel conduct Lord Malcolm to an inn, explaining
that it was his duty to present himself to the governor; and, being
detained to sup with him, was seen no more till they started the next
morning.&nbsp; The governor rode out with them some ten miles, with
a strong guard of spearmen; and after parting with him they pushed on
to the south.</p>
<p>After the first day&rsquo;s journey, Malcolm was amazed to see Sir
James mount without any of his defensive armour, which was piled on
the spare horse; his head was covered by a chaperon, or flat cap with
a short curtain to it, and his sword was the only weapon he retained.&nbsp;
Nigel was also nearly unarmed, and Sir James advised Malcolm himself
to lay aside the light hawberk he wore; then, at his amazed look, said,
&lsquo;Poor lad! he never saw the day when he could ride abroad scathless.&nbsp;
When will the breadth of Scotland be as safe as these English hills?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was very kind to his young companion, treating him in all things
like a guest, pointing out what was worthy of note, and explaining what
was new and surprising.&nbsp; Malcolm would have asked much concerning
the King, to whom he was bound, but these questions were the only ones
Sir James put aside, saying that his kinsman would one day learn that
it ill beseemed those who were about a king&rsquo;s person to speak
of him freely.</p>
<p>One night was spent at Durham, the parent of Coldingham, and here
Malcolm felt at home, far more grand as was that mighty cathedral institution.&nbsp;
There it stood, with the Weir encircling it, on its own fair though
mighty hill, with all the glory of its Norman mister and lovely Lady-chapel;
yet it seemed to the boy more like a glorified Coldingham than like
a strange region.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The peace of God rests on the place,&rsquo; he said, when
Sir James asked his thoughts as he looked back at the grand mass of
buildings.&nbsp; &lsquo;These are the only spots where the holy and
tender can grow, like the Palestine lilies sheltered from the blast
in the Abbot&rsquo;s garden at Coldingham.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad, it were an ill world did lilies only grow in abbots&rsquo;
gardens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is an ill world,&rsquo; said Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us hear what you say in a month&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; replied
the knight, lightly: then dreaming over the words.</p>
<p>A few days more, and they were riding among the lovely rock and woodland
scenery of Yorkshire, when suddenly there leaped from behind a bush
three or four young men, with a loud shout of &lsquo;Stand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reivers!&rsquo; thought Malcolm, sick with dismay, as the
foremost grasped Sir James&rsquo;s bridle; but the latter merely laughed,
saying, &lsquo;How now, Hal! be these your old tricks?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, when such prizes are errant,&rsquo; said the assailant
and Sir James, springing from his horse, embraced him and his companion
with a cordiality that made Malcolm not a little uneasy.&nbsp; Could
he have been kidnapped by a false Englishman into a den of robbers for
the sake of his ransom?</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are strict to your time,&rsquo; said the chief robber.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I knew you would be.&nbsp; So, when Ned Marmion came to Beverley,
and would have us to see his hunting at Tanfield, we came on thinking
to meet you.&nbsp; Marmion here has a nooning spread in the forest;
ere we go on to Thirsk, where I have a matter to settle between two
wrong-headed churls.&nbsp; How has it been with you, Jamie? you have
added to your mein&eacute;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Hal! never in all your cut-purse days did you fall on
such an emprise as I have achieved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us hear,&rsquo; said Hal, linking his arm in Sir James&rsquo;s,
who turned for a moment to say, &lsquo;Take care of the lad, John; he
is a young kinsman of mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kinsman!&rsquo; thought Malcolm; &lsquo;do all wandering Stewarts
claim kin to the blood royal?&rsquo; but then, as he looked at Sir James&rsquo;s
stately head, he felt that no assumption could be unbecoming in one
of such a presence, and so kind to himself; and, ashamed of the moment&rsquo;s
petulance, dismounted, and, as John said, &lsquo;This is the way to
our noon meat,&rsquo; he let himself be conducted through the trees
to a glade, sheltered from the wind, where a Lenten though not unsavoury
meal of bread, dried fish, and eggs was laid out on the grass, in a
bright warm sunshine; and Hal, declaring himself to have a hunter&rsquo;s
appetite, and that he knew Jamie had been starved in Scotland, and was
as lean as a greyhound, seated himself on the grass, and to Malcolm&rsquo;s
extreme surprise, not to say disgust, was served by Lord Marmion on
the knee and with doffed cap.</p>
<p>While the meal was being eaten, Malcolm studied the strangers.&nbsp;
Lord Marmion was a good-humoured, hearty-looking young Yorkshireman,
but the other two attracted his attention far more.&nbsp; They were
evidently brothers, one perhaps just above, the other just below, thirty;
both of the most perfect mould of symmetry, activity, and strength,
though perhaps more inclining to agility than robustness.&nbsp; Both
were fair-complexioned, and wore no beard; but John was the paler, graver,
and more sedate, and his aquiline profile had an older look than that
borne by Hal&rsquo;s perfectly regular features.&nbsp; It would have
been hard to define what instantly showed the seniority of his brother,
for the clearness of his colouring&mdash;bright red and white like a
lady&rsquo;s&mdash;his short, well-moulded chin, and the fresh earnestness
and animation of his countenance, gave an air of perpetual youth in
spite of the scar of an arrow on the cheek which told of at least one
battle; but there were those manifestations of being used to be the
first which are the evident tokens of elder sonship, and the lordly
manner more and more impressed Malcolm.&nbsp; He was glad that his own
Sir James was equal in dignity, as well as superior in height, and he
thought the terrible red lightning of those auburn eyes would be impossible
to the sparkling azure eyes of the Englishman, steadfast, keen, and
brilliant unspeakably though they were; but so soon as Sir James seemed
to have made his explanation, the look was most winningly turned on
him, a hand held out, and he was thus greeted: &lsquo;Welcome, my young
Prince Malcolm; I am happy that your cousin thinks so well of our cheer,
that he has brought you to partake it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His keeper, Somerset,&rsquo; thought Malcolm, as he bowed
stiffly; &lsquo;he seems to treat me coolly enough.&nbsp; I come to
serve my King,&rsquo; he said, but he was scarcely heard; for as Hal
unbuckled his sword before sitting down on the grass, he thrust into
his bosom a small black volume, with which he seemed to have been beguiling
the time; and John exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There goes Godfrey de Bulloin.&nbsp; I tell you, Jamie, &rsquo;tis
well you are come!&nbsp; Now have I some one to speak with.&nbsp; Ever
since Harry borrowed my Lady of Westmoreland&rsquo;s book of the Holy
War, he has not had a word to fling at me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Sir James, &lsquo;I saw a book, indeed, of
the Holy Land!&nbsp; It would tempt him too much to hear how near the
Border it dwells!&nbsp; What was it named, Malcolm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The &ldquo;Itinerarium of Adamnanus,&rdquo;&rsquo; replied
Malcolm, blushing at the sudden appeal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard of it,&rsquo; cried the English
knight.&nbsp; &lsquo;I sent to half the convent libraries to beg the
loan when Gilbert de Lannoy set forth for the survey of Palestine.&nbsp;
Does the Monk of Iona tell what commodity of landing there may be on
the coast?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm had the sea-port towns at his fingers&rsquo; ends, and having
in the hard process of translation, and reading and re-reading one of
the few books that came into his hands, nearly mastered the contents,
he was able to reply with promptness and precision, although with much
amazement, for</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Much he marvelled a knight of pride<br />
Like book-bosomed priest should ride;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>nor had he ever before found his accomplishments treated as aught
but matters of scorn among the princes and nobles with whom he had occasionally
been thrown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good! good!&rsquo; said Sir Harry at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well
read, and clearly called to mind.&nbsp; The stripling will do you credit,
James.&nbsp; Where have you studied, fair cousin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cousin! was it English fashion to make a cousin of everybody?&nbsp;
But gentle, humble Malcolm had no resentment in him, and felt gratified
at the friendly tone of so grand and manly-looking a knight.&nbsp; &lsquo;At
home,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;with a travelling scholar who had studied
at Padua and Paris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is where you Scots love to haunt!&nbsp; But know you
how they are served there?&nbsp; I have seen the gibbet where the Mayor
of Paris hung two clerks&rsquo; sons for loving his daughters over well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The clerks&rsquo; twa sons of Owsenford that were foully slain!&rsquo;
cried Malcolm, his face lighting up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Sir, have you
seen their gibbet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What? were they friends of yours?&rsquo; asked Hal, much amused,
and shaking his head merrily at Sir James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ill company,
I fear&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only in a ballad,&rsquo; said Malcolm, colouring, &lsquo;that
tells how at Yuletide the ghosts came to their mother with their hats
made of the birk that grew at the gates of Paradise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A rare ballad must that be!&rsquo; exclaimed Hal.&nbsp; &lsquo;Canst
sing it?&nbsp; Or are you weary?&mdash;Marmion, prithee tell some of
the fellows to bring my harp from the baggage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His own harp is with ours,&rsquo; said Sir James; &lsquo;he
will make a better figure therewith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At his sign, the attendant, Nigel, the only person besides Lord Marmion
of Tanfield who had been present at the meal, besides the two Stewarts
and the English brothers, rose and disappeared between the trees, beyond
which a hum of voices, an occasional laugh, and the stamping of horses
and jingling of bridles, betokened that a good many followers were in
waiting.&nbsp; Malcolm&rsquo;s harp was quickly brought, having been
slung in its case to the saddle of Halbert&rsquo;s horse; and as he
had used it to beguile the last evening&rsquo;s halt, it did not need
much tuning.&nbsp; Surprised as his princely notions were at being commanded
rather than requested to sing, the sweet encouraging smile and tone
of kind authority banished all hesitation in complying, and he gave
the ballad of the Clerks&rsquo; Twa Sons of Owsenford with much grace
and sweetness, while the weakness of his voice was compensated by the
manlier strains with which Sir James occasionally chimed in.&nbsp; Then,
as Harry gave full meed of appreciative praise and thanks, Sir James
said, &lsquo;Lend me thine harp, Malcolm; I have learnt thy song now;
and thou, Harry, must hear and own how far our Scottish minstrelsy exceeds
thy boasted Chevy Chase.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And forth rang in all the mellow beauty of his voice that most glorious
of ballads, the Battle of Otterburn, as much more grand than it had
been when he heard it from the glee-man or from Malcolm, as a magnificent
voice, patriotic enthusiasm, and cultivation and refinement, could make
it.&nbsp; He had lost himself and all around in the passion of the victory,
the pathos of the death.&nbsp; But no such bright look of thanks recompensed
him.&nbsp; Harry&rsquo;s face grew dark, and he growled, &lsquo;Douglas
dead?&nbsp; Ay, he wins more fields so than alive!&nbsp; I wish you
would keep my old Shrewsbury friend, Earl Tyneman, as you call him,
at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis ill keeping the scholars in bounds when the master
is away,&rsquo; returned Sir James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, by this time Tom has taught them how to transgress&mdash;sent
them home with the long scourge from robbing orchards in Anjou.&nbsp;
He writes to me almost with his foot in the stirrup, about to give Douglas
and Buchan a lesson.&nbsp; I shall make short halts and long stages
south.&nbsp; This is too far off for tidings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Sir John, with a satirical curl of the lip;
&lsquo;above all, when fair ladies brook not to ink their ivory fingers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There spake the envious fiend,&rsquo; laughed the elder brother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;John bears not the sight of what he will not or cannot get.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never be chained to a lady&rsquo;s litter, nor
be forced to loiter till her wimple is pinned,&rsquo; retorted John.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nor do I like dames with two husbands besides.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One would have cancelled the other, as grammarians tell us,&rsquo;
said Harry, &lsquo;if thy charms, John, had cancelled thine hook nose!&nbsp;
I would they had, ere her first marriage.&nbsp; Humfrey will burn his
fingers there, and we must hasten back to look after that among other
things.&mdash;My Lord Marmion,&rsquo; he added, starting hastily up,
and calling to him as he stood at some distance conversing with the
Scottish Nigel, &lsquo;so please you, let us have the horses;&rsquo;
and as the gentleman hastened to give the summons, he said, &lsquo;We
shall make good way now.&nbsp; We shall come on Watling Street.&nbsp;
Ha, Jamie, when shall we prove ourselves better men than a pack of Pagan
Romans, by having a set of roads fit for man or beast, of our own making
instead of theirs half decayed?&nbsp; Look where I will, in England
or France, their roads are the same in build&mdash;firm as the world
itself, straight as arrows.&nbsp; An army is off one&rsquo;s mind when
once one gets on a Roman way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll learn the trick, and
have them from Edinburgh to Bordeaux ere ten years are out; and then,
what with traffic and converse with the world, and ready justice, neither
Highland men minor Gascons will have leisure or taste for robbery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps Gascons and Scots will have a voice in the matter,&rsquo;
said James, a little stiffly; and the horses being by this time brought,
Sir Harry mounted, and keeping his horse near that of young Malcolm,
to whom he had evidently taken a fancy, he began to talk to him in so
friendly and winning a manner, that he easily drew from the youth the
whole history of his acquaintance with Sir James Stewart, of the rescue
of his sister, and the promise to conduct him to the captive King of
Scots, as the only means of saving him from his rapacious kindred.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor lad!&rsquo; said Harry, gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know King James, Sir?&rsquo; asked Malcolm, timidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Know him?&rsquo; said Harry, turning round to scan the boy
with his merry blue eye.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know him&mdash;yes; that as
far as a poor Welsh knight can know his Grace of Scotland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Sir, will he be good lord to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh! that&rsquo;s as you may take him.&nbsp; I would not be
one of yonder Scots under his hands!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has he learned to hate his own countrymen?&rsquo; asked Malcolm,
in an awe-stricken voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hate?&nbsp; I trow he has little to love them for.&nbsp; He
is a good fellow enough, my young lord, when left to himself; but best
beware.&nbsp; Lions in a cage have strange tempers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A courier rode up at the moment, and presented some letters, which
Sir Harry at once opened and read, beckoning his brother and Sir James
to his side, while Malcolm rode on in their wake, in a state of dismay
and bewilderment.&nbsp; Nigel and Lord Marmion were together at so great
an interval that he could not fall back on them, nor learn from them
who these brothers were.&nbsp; And there was something in the ironical
suppressed pity with which Harry had spoken of his prospects with the
King of Scots, that terrified him all the more, because he knew that
Sir James and Nigel would both hold it unworthy of him to have spoken
freely of his own sovereign with an Englishman.&nbsp; Would James be
another Walter? and, if so, would Sir James Stewart protect him?&nbsp;
He had acquired much affection for, and strong reliance on, the knight;
but there was something unexplained, and his heart sank.</p>
<p>The smooth line of Watling Street at length opened into the old town
of Thirsk, and here bells were ringing, flags flying from the steeple,
music sounded, a mayor and his corporation in their robes rode slowly
forth, crowds lined the road-side, caps were flung up, and a tremendous
shout arose, &lsquo;God save King Harry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm gazed about more utterly discomfited.&nbsp; There was &lsquo;Harry,&rsquo;
upright on his horse, listening with a gracious smile, while the mayor
rehearsed a speech about welcome and victories, and the hopeful queen,
and, what was still more to the purpose, tendered a huge pair of gauntlets,
each filled to the brim, one with gold, and the other with silver pieces.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh!&nbsp; Thanks, Master Mayor, but these gloves must be cleared,
ere there is room for me to use them in battle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And handing the gold glove to his brother, he scattered the contents
of the silver one far and wide among the populace, who shouted their
blessings louder than ever, and thus he reached the market-place.&nbsp;
There all was set forth as for the lists, a horseman in armour on either
side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heigh now, Sirs,&rsquo; said Harry, &lsquo;have we not wars
enough toward without these mummings of vanity?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is no show, my Lord King,&rsquo; returned the mayor,
abashed.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is deadly earnest.&nbsp; These are two honourable
gentlemen of Yorkshire, who are come hither to fight out their quarrel
before your Grace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two honourable foolsheads!&rsquo; muttered Harry; then, raising
his voice, &lsquo;Come hither, gentlemen, let us hear your quarrel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two gentlemen were big Yorkshiremen, heavy-browed, and their
native shrewdness packed far away behind a bumpkin stolidity and surliness
that barely allowed them to show respect to the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So please you, Sir,&rsquo; growled the first in his throat,
&lsquo;here stands Christopher Kitson of Barrowbridge, ready to avouch
himself a true man, and prove in yonder fellow&rsquo;s teeth that it
was not a broken-kneed beast that I sent up for a heriard to my Lord
Archbishop when my father died; but that he of Easingwold is a black
slanderer and backbiter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here,&rsquo; shouted the other, &lsquo;stands honest William
Trenton of Easingwold, ready to thrust his lies down his throat, and
prove on his body that the heriard he sent to my Lord Archbishop was
a sorry jade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That were best proved by the beast&rsquo;s body,&rsquo; interposed
time King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; proceeded the doughty Kitson, as though repeating
a lesson, &lsquo;having vainly pleaded the matter these nine years,
we are come to demand licence to fight it out, with lance, sword, and
dagger, in your royal presence, to set the matter at rest for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Breaking a man&rsquo;s head to prove the soundness of a horse!&rsquo;
ejaculated Harry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your licence is given, Sir King?&rsquo; demanded Kitson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My licence is given for a combat <i>&agrave; l&rsquo;outrance</i>,&rsquo;
said Henry; but, as they were about to flounder back on their big farm-horses,
he raised his voice to a thundering sound: &lsquo;Solely on this condition,
that he who slays his neighbour, be he Trenton or Kitson, shall hang
for the murder ere I leave Thirsk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a recoil, and the mayor himself ventured to observe something
about the judgment of God, and &lsquo;never so seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I say,&rsquo; thundered Henry, and his blue eyes seemed
to flame with vehement indignation, &lsquo;I say that the ordeal of
battle is shamefully abused, and that it is a taking of God&rsquo;s
name&mdash;ay, and man&rsquo;s life&mdash;in vain, to appeal thereto
on every coxcomb&rsquo;s quarrel, risking the life that was given him
to serve God&rsquo;s ends, not his own sullen fancy.&nbsp; I will have
an end of such things!&mdash;And you, gentlemen, since the heriard is
dead, or too old to settle the question, shake hands, and if you must
let blood, come to France with me next month, and flesh your knives
on French and Scots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So please you, Sir,&rsquo; grumbled Kitson, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
Mistress Agnes of Mineshull; she&rsquo;s been in doubt between the two
of us these five years, and she&rsquo;d promised to wed whichever of
us got the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll settle her mind for her!&nbsp; Whichever I find
foremost among the French, I&rsquo;ll send home to her a knight, and
with better sense to boot than to squabble for nine years as to an old
horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then dismounted, and was conducted into the town-hall, where a
banquet was prepared, taking by the hand Sir James Stewart, and followed
by his brother John, and by Malcolm, who felt as though his brain were
turning, partly with amazement, partly with confusion at his own dulness,
as he perceived that not only was the free-spoken Hal, Henry of Monmouth,
King of England, but that his wandering benefactor, the captive knight,
whose claim of kindred he had almost spurned, was his native sovereign,
James the First of Scotland.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV: THE TIDINGS OF BEAUG&Eacute;</h2>
<p>Malcolm understood it at last.&nbsp; In the great chamber where he
was bidden to wait within &lsquo;Nigel&rsquo; till &lsquo;Sir James&rsquo;
came from a private conference with &lsquo;Harry,&rsquo; he had all
explained to him, but within a curtness and brevity that must not be
imitated in the present narrative.</p>
<p>The squire Nigel was in fact Sir Nigel Baird, Baron of Bairdsbrae,
the gentleman to whom poor King Robert II. had committed the charge
of his young son James, when at fourteen he had been sent to France,
nominally for education, but in reality to secure him from the fate
of his brother Rothsay.</p>
<p>Captured by English vessels on the way, the heir of Scotland had
been too valuable a prize to be resigned by the politic Henry IV., who
had lodged him at Windsor Castle, together with Edmund Mortimer, earl
of March, and placed both under the nominal charge of the Prince of
Wales, a youth of a few years older.&nbsp; Unjust as was the detention,
it had been far from severe; the boys had as much liberty as their age
and recreation required, and received the choicest training both in
the arts of war and peace.&nbsp; They were bred up in close intercourse
with the King&rsquo;s own four sons, and were united with them by the
warmest sympathy.</p>
<p>In fact, since usurpation had filled Henry of Lancaster&rsquo;s mind
with distrust and jealousy, his eldest son had been in no such enviable
position as to be beyond the capacity of fellow-feeling for the royal
prisoner.</p>
<p>Of a peculiarly frank, open, and affectionate nature, young Henry
had so warmly loved the gentle and fascinating Richard II., that his
trust in the father, of whom he had seen little in his boyhood, had
received a severe shock through Richard&rsquo;s fate.&nbsp; Under the
influence of a new, suspicious, and avaricious wife, the King kept his
son as much at a distance as possible, chiefly on the Welsh marches,
learning the art of war under Hotspur and Oldcastle; and when the father
and son were brought together again, the bold, free bearing and extraordinary
ability of the Prince filled the suspicious mind of the King with alarm
and jealousy.&nbsp; To keep him down, give him no money, and let him
gain no influence, was the narrow policy of the King; and Henry, chafing,
dreaming, feeling the injustice, and pining for occupation, shared his
complaints within James, and in many a day-dream restored him freely
to his throne, and together redressed the wrongs of the world.&nbsp;
Meantime, James studied deep in preparation, and recreated himself with
poetry, inspired by the charms of Joan Beaufort, the lovely daughter
of the King&rsquo;s legitimatized brother, the Earl of Somerset; while
Henry persisted in a boy&rsquo;s passionate love to King Richard&rsquo;s
maiden widow, Isabel of France.&nbsp; Entirely unrequited as his affection
was, it had a beneficial effect.&nbsp; Next after his deep sense of
religion, it kept his life pure and chivalrous.&nbsp; He was for ever
faithful to his future wife, even when Isabel had been returned to France,
and his romantic passion had fixed itself on her younger sister Catherine,
whom he endowed in imagination with all he had seen or supposed in her.</p>
<p>Credited with every excess by the tongue of his stepmother, too active-minded
not to indulge in freakish sports and experiments in life very astounding
to commonplace minds, sometimes when in dire distress even helping himself
to his unpaid allowance from his father&rsquo;s mails, and always with
buoyant high spirits and unfailing drollery that scandalized the grave
seniors of the Court, there is full proof that Prince Hal ever kept
free from the gross vices which a later age has fancied inseparably
connected with his frolics; and though always in disgrace, the vexation
of the Court, and a by-word for mirth, he was true to the grand ideal
he was waiting to accomplish, and never dimmed the purity and loftiness
of his aim.&nbsp; That little band of princely youths, who sported,
studied, laughed, sang, and schemed in the glades of Windsor, were strangely
brought together&mdash;the captive exiled King, the disinherited heir
of the realm, and the sons of the monarch who held the one in durance
and occupied the throne of the other; and yet their affection had all
the frank delight of youthful friendship.&nbsp; The younger lads were
in more favour with their father than was the elder.&nbsp; Thomas was
sometimes preferred to him in a mortifying manner, John&rsquo;s grave,
quiet nature prevented him from ever incurring displeasure, and Humfrey
was the spoilt pet of the family; but nothing could lessen Harry&rsquo;s
large-minded love of his brothers; and he was the idol and hero of the
whole young party, who implicitly believed in his mighty destinies as
a renovator of the world, the deliverer of Jerusalem, and restorer of
the unity and purity of the Church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harry the Fifth was crowned,&rsquo; and with the full intention
of carrying out his great dream.&nbsp; But his promise of releasing
James became matter of question.&nbsp; The House of Albany, who held
the chief power in Scotland, had bound Henry IV. over not to free their
master; and it was plain that to send him home before his welcome was
ensured would be but tossing him on their spears.&nbsp; In vain James
pleaded that he was no boy, and was able to protect himself; and vowed
that when the faithful should rally round his standard, he would be
more than a match for his enemies; or that if not, he would rather die
free than live in bondage.&nbsp; Henry would not listen, and insisted
upon retaining him until he should himself be at leisure to bring him
home with a high hand, utterly disregarding his assurance that this
would only be rendering him in the eyes of his subjects another despised
and hated Balliol.</p>
<p>Deeming himself a divinely-appointed redresser of wrongs, Henry was
already beginning on his great work of purifying Europe in preparation
for his mighty Crusade; and having won that splendid victory which laid
distracted France at his feet, he only waited to complete the conquest
as thoroughly and rapidly as might be; and, lest his grand purpose should
be obstructed, this great practical visionary, though full of kindness
and generosity, kept in thraldom a whole troop of royal and noble captives.</p>
<p>He had, however, been so far moved by James&rsquo;s entreaties, as
to consent that when he himself offered his devotions at the shrine
of St. John of Beverley, the native saint who shared with the two cordwainers
his gratitude for the glories of &lsquo;Crispin Crispian&rsquo;s day,&rsquo;
his prisoner should, unknown to any save the few who shared the pilgrimage,
push on to reconnoitre his own country, and judge for himself, having
first sworn to reveal himself to no one, and to avoid all who could
recognize him.&nbsp; James had visited Glenuskie within a special view
to profiting by the wisdom of Sir David Drummond, and had then been
at Stirling, Edinburgh, and Perth.&nbsp; On his way back, falling in
with Malcolm in his distress, he had conceived the project of taking
him to England; and finding himself already more than half recognized
by Sir David, had obtained his most grateful and joyous consent.&nbsp;
In truth, James&rsquo;s heart had yearned to his young cousin, his own
situation had become much more lonely of late; for Henry was no longer
the comrade he had once been, since he had become a keeper instead of
a fellow-sufferer.&nbsp; It was true that he did his best to forget
this by lavishing indulgences on his captive, and insisting on being
treated on terms of brotherly familiarity; but though his transcendent
qualities commanded love, the intimacy could be but a semblance of the
once equal friendship.&nbsp; Moreover, that conspiracy which cost the
life of the Earl of Cambridge had taught James that cautious reserve
was needed in dealing with even his old friends the princes, so easily
might he be accused of plotting either with Henry&rsquo;s immediate
heir or with the Mortimers; and, in this guarded life, he had hailed
with delight the opportunity of taking to himself the young orphan cousin
of kindred blood, of congenial tastes, and home-like speech, whom he
might treat at once as a younger brother and friend, and mould by and
by into a trusty counsellor and assistant.&nbsp; That peculiar wistfulness
and gentleness of Malcolm&rsquo;s look and manner, together with the
refinement and intellect apparent to all who conversed with him without
alarming him, had won the King&rsquo;s heart, and made him long to keep
the boy with him.&nbsp; As to Malcolm&rsquo;s longing for the cloister,
he deemed it the result of the weakly health and refined nature which
shrank from the barbarism of the outer world, and he thought it would
pass away under shelter from the rude taunts of the fierce cousins,
at a distance from the well-meaning exhortations of the monks, and at
the spectacle of brave and active men who could also be pious, conscientious,
and cultivated.&nbsp; In the renewed sojourn at Windsor which James
apprehended, the training of such a youth as Malcolm of Glenuskie would
be no small solace.</p>
<p>By the time Malcolm had learnt as much of all this as Sir Nigel Baird
knew, or chose to communicate, the King entered the room.&nbsp; He flung
himself on his knees, exclaiming, with warm gratitude, as he kissed
the King&rsquo;s hand, &lsquo;My liege, I little kenned&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I meant thee to ken little,&rsquo; said James, smiling.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, laddie, wilt thou share the prisoner&rsquo;s cell?&mdash;Ay,
Bairdsbrae, you were a true prophet.&nbsp; Harry will do all himself,
and will not hear of losing me to deal with my own people at my own
gate.&nbsp; No, no, he&rsquo;ll have me back with Southron bows and
bills, so soon as this small trifle of France lies quiet in his grasp!&nbsp;
I had nearly flung back my parole in his face, and told him that no
English sword should set me on the Bruce&rsquo;s throne; but there is
something in Harry of Monmouth that one <i>must</i> love, and there
are moments when to see and hear him one would as soon doubt the commission
of an angel with a flaming sword.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A black angel!&rsquo; growled Sir Nigel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scoff and chafe, Baird, but look at his work.&nbsp; Look at
Normandy, freed from misrule and exaction, in peace and order.&nbsp;
Look at this land.&nbsp; Was ever king so loved?&nbsp; Or how durst
he act as he did this day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, an it were so at home,&rsquo; said Baird, &lsquo;I had
as lief stay here as where a man is not free to fight out his own feud.&nbsp;
Even this sackless callant thought it shame to see two honest men baulked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Scotland!&rsquo; sighed James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Woe is the
land where such thoughts come readiest to gray-haired men and innocent
boys.&nbsp; I tell you, cousin, this precious right is the very cause
that our poor country is so lawless and bloody, that yon poor silly
sparrow would fain be caged for fear of the kites and carrion-crows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alack, my Lord, let me but have my way.&nbsp; I cannot fight!&nbsp;
Let Patrick Drummond have my sister and my lands, and your service will
be far better done,&rsquo; said Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know all that,&rsquo; said the King, kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
is time enough for settling that question; and meantime you will not
be spoilt for monk or priest by cheering me awhile in my captivity.&nbsp;
I need you, laddie,&rsquo; me added, laying his hand on the boy&rsquo;s
shoulder, with all the instinctive fascination of a Stewart.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
lack a comrade of my own blood, for I am all alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Sir!&rsquo; and Malcolm, looking into his face, saw it
full of tenderness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Books and masters you shall have,&rsquo; continued James,
&lsquo;such as for church or state, cathedral, cloister, or camp, shall
render you the meeter prince; and I pass you my royal word, that if
at full age the cowl be your choice, I will not gainsay you.&nbsp; Meantime,
abide with me, and be the young brother I have yearned for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King threw his arms round Malcolm, who felt, and unconsciously
manifested, a strange bliss in that embrace, even while fixed in his
determination that nothing should make him swerve from his chosen path,
nor render him false to his promise to Patrick and Lilias.&nbsp; It
was a strange change, from being despised and down-trodden by fierce
cousins, or only fondled, pitied, and treated with consideration by
his own nearest and dearest friends, to be the chosen companion of a
king, and <i>such</i> a king.&nbsp; Nor could it be a wile of Satan,
thought Malcolm, since James still promised him liberty of choice.&nbsp;
He would ask counsel of a priest next time he went to confession; and
in the meantime, in the full tide of gratitude, admiration, and affection,
he gave himself up to the enjoyment of his new situation, and of time
King&rsquo;s kindness and solicitude.&nbsp; This was indeed absolutely
that of an elder brother; for, observing that Malcolm&rsquo;s dress
and equipments, the work of Glenuskie looms, supplemented by a few Edinburgh
purchases, was uncouth enough to attract some scornful glances from
the crowd who came out to welcome the royal entrance into York the next
day, he instantly sent Brewster in search of the best tailor and lorimer
in the city, and provided so handsomely for the appearance of young
Glenuskie, his horse, and his attendants, that the whole floor of their
quarters was strewn with doublets, boots, chaperons, and gloves, saddles,
bridles, and spurs, when the Duke of Bedford loitered into the room,
and began to banter James for thus (as he supposed) pranking himself
out to meet the lady of his love; and then bemoaned the fripperies that
had become the rage in their once bachelor court, vowing, between sport
and earnest, that Hal was so enamoured of his fair bride, that anon
the conquest of France would be left to himself and his brother, Tom
of Clarence; while James retorted by thrusts at Bedford&rsquo;s own
rusticity of garb, and by endeavouring to force on him a pair of shoes
with points like ram&rsquo;s horns, as a special passport to the favour
of Dame Jac&mdash;a lady who seemed to be the object of Duke John&rsquo;s
great distaste.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice was heard in the gallery of the great old mansion
where they were lodged.&nbsp; &lsquo;John!&nbsp; John!&nbsp; Here!&mdash;Where
is the Duke, I say?&rsquo;&nbsp; It was thick and husky, as with some
terrible emotion; and the King and Duke had already started in dismay
before the door was thrown open, and King Henry stood among them, his
face of a burning red.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See here, John!&rsquo; he said, holding out a letter; and
then, with an accent of wrathful anguish, and a terrible frown, he turned
on James, exclaiming, &lsquo;I would send you to the Tower, Sir, did
I think you had a hand in this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm trembled, and sidled nearer his prince; while James, with
an equally fierce look, replied, &lsquo;Hold, Sir!&nbsp; Send me where
you will, but dare not dishonour my name!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then changing,
as he saw the exceeding grief on Henry&rsquo;s brow, and heard John&rsquo;s
smothered cry of dismay, &lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Harry, what
is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This!&rsquo; said Henry, less loudly, less hotly, but still
with an agony of indignation: &lsquo;Thomas is dead&mdash;and by the
hand of two of your traitor Scots!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Murdered!&rsquo; cried James, aghast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Murdered by all honest laws of war, but on the battlefield,&rsquo;
said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your cousin of Buchan and old Douglas fell
on my brave fellows at Beaug&eacute;, when they were spent with travel
to stop the robberies in Anjou.&nbsp; They closed in with their pikes
on my brave fellows, took Somerset prisoner, and for Thomas, while he
was dealing with a knight named Swinton in front, the villain Buchan
comes behind and cleaves his head in twain; and that is what you Scots
call fighting!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was worthy of a son of Albany!&rsquo; said James.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Would that vengeance were in my power!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, you loved him!&rsquo; said Henry, grasping James&rsquo;s
hand, his passion softened into a burst of tears, as he wrung his prisoner&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, who did not love him, my brave, free-hearted
brother?&nbsp; And that I&mdash;I should have dallied here and left
him to bear the brunt, and be cut off by you felon Scots!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he hid his face, struggling within an agony of heart-rending grief,
which seemed to sway his whole tall, powerful frame as he leant against
the high back of a chair; while John, together with James, was imploring
him not to accuse himself, for his presence had been needful at home;
and, to turn the tenor of his thought, James inquired whether there
were any further disaster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not as yet,&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;there is not a man left
in that heaven-abandoned crew who knows how to profit by what they have
got! but I must back again ere the devil stir them up a man of wit!&mdash;And
you, Sir, can you take order with these heady Scots?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From Windsor? no,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;but set me in
the saddle, let me learn war under such a captain as yourself, and maybe
they will not take the field against me; or if they do, the slayer of
Clarence shall rue it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be it so,&rsquo; said Henry, wringing his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
shall with me to France, Jamie, and see war.&nbsp; The Scots should
flock to the Lion rampant, and without them the French are mo better
than deer, under the fool and murderer they call Dauphin.&nbsp; Yet,
alas! will any success give me back my brother&mdash;my brother, the
brave and true?&rsquo; he added, weeping again within time <i>abandon</i>
of an open nature and simple age.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was for my sins, my
forgetfulness of my great work, that this has come on me.&mdash;Ho,
Marmion! carry these tidings from me to the Dean; pray him that the
knell be tolled at the Minster, and a requiem sung for my brother and
all who fell with him.&nbsp; We will be there ourselves, and the mayor
must hold us excused from his banquet; these men are too loyal not to
grieve for their King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, with his arm round the neck of his brother John, Henry left
the room; and before another word could be said, Sir Nigel was there,
having only retired on the King&rsquo;s entrance.&nbsp; The news was
of course all over the house, and with an old attendant&rsquo;s freedom
he exclaimed, &lsquo;So, Sir, the English have found tough cummers at
last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not too honourably,&rsquo; said James, sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hout, would not the puir loons be glad enow of any gate of
coming by a clout at the man&rsquo;s brother that keeps you captive!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have taken away one of those I loved best!&rsquo; said
James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m no speaking ill of the lad Clarence himself,&rsquo;
said Nigel; &lsquo;he was a braw youth, leal and bold, and he has died
in his helm and spurs, as a good knight should.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d wish
none of these princes a waur ending.&nbsp; Moreover, could Swinton have
had the wit to keep him living, he&rsquo;d have been a bonnie barter
for you, my Lord; but ony way the fight was a gallant one, and the very
squire that brought the tidings cannot deny that our Scots fought like
lions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would Douglas but so fight in any good quarrel!&rsquo; sighed
the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what are you longing to ask, Malcolm?&nbsp;
Is it for your kinsman Patrick?&nbsp; I fear me that there is little
chance of your hearing by name of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wot not,&rsquo; said Sir Nigel; &lsquo;I did but ask for
that hare-brained young cousin of mine, Davie Baird, that must needs
be off on this journey to France; and the squire tells me he was no
herald, to be answerable for the rogues that fought on the other side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall soon see for ourselves,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;I
am to make this campaign.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You! you, my liege!&nbsp; Against your own ally, and under
the standard of England!&nbsp; Woe&rsquo;s me, how could ye be so lost!&rsquo;</p>
<p>James argued on his own conviction that the true France was with
poor Charles VI., and that it was doing the country no service to prolong
the resistance of the Armagnacs and the Dauphin, who then appeared mere
partisans instead of patriots.&nbsp; As to fighting under the English
banner, no subjection was involved in an adventurer king so doing: had
not the King of Bohemia thus fought at Crecy? and was not the King of
Sicily with the French army?&nbsp; Moreover, James himself felt the
necessity of gaining some experience in the art of war.&nbsp; Theoretically
he had studied it with all his might, from C&aelig;sar, Quintus Curtius,
and that favourite modern authority, the learned ecclesiastic, Jean
Pav&eacute;, who was the Vauban of the fifteenth century; and he had
likewise obtained greedily all the information he could from Henry himself
and his warriors; but all this had convinced him that if war was to
be more than a mere raid, conducted by mere spirit and instinct, some
actual apprenticeship was necessary.&nbsp; Even for such a dash, Henry
himself had told him that he would find his book-knowledge an absolute
impediment without some practice, and would probably fail for that very
reason when opposed to tough old seasoned warriors.&nbsp; And, prudence
apart, James, at five-and-twenty, absolutely glowed with shame at the
thought that every one of his companions had borne arms for at least
ten years past, while his arrows had no mark but the target, his lances
had all been broken in the tilt-yard.&nbsp; It was this argument that
above all served to pacify old Bairdsbrae; though he confessed himself
very uneasy as to the prejudice it would create in Scotland, and so
evidently loathed the expedition, that James urged on him to return
to Scotland, instead of continuing his attendance.&nbsp; There was no
fear but that his ransom would be accepted, and he had been absent twelve
years from his home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, my Lord; I sware to your father that I&rsquo;d never
quit you till I brought you safe home again, and, God willing, I&rsquo;ll
keep my oath.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s this puir callant to do, that you
were set upon rearing upon your books at Windsor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall choose,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Either he
shall study at the learned university at Oxford or at Paris, or he shall
ride with me, and see how cities and battles are won.&nbsp; Speak not
yet, cousin; it takes many months to shake out the royal banner, and
you shall look about you ere deciding.&nbsp; Now give me yonder black
cloak; they are assembling for the requiem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm, as he followed his king, was not a little amazed to see
that Henry, the magnificent victor, was wrapped in a plain black serge
garment, his short dark hair uncovered, his feet bare; and that on arriving
at the Minster he threw himself on his knees, almost on his face, before
the choir steps, there remaining while the <i>De profundis</i> and the
like solemn and mournful strains floated through the dark vaultings
above him, perhaps soothing while giving expression to the agony of
his affliction, and self-accusation, not for the devastation of the
turbulent country of an insane sovereign, but for his having relaxed
in the mighty work of renovation that he had imposed on himself.</p>
<p>Even when the service was ended, the King would not leave the Minster.&nbsp;
He lifted himself up to bid Bedford and his companions return; but for
himself, he intended to remain and confess, in preparation for being
&lsquo;houselled&rsquo; at the Mass for the dead early the next morning,
before hastening on the southern journey.</p>
<p>Was this, thought the bewildered Malcolm as he fell asleep, the godless
atmosphere he had been used to think all that was not Glenuskie or Coldingham&mdash;England
above all?</p>
<p>Indeed, in the frosty twilight of the spring morning, though Henry
was now clad in his usual garb, sleeplessness, sorrow, and fasting made
him as wan and haggard as any ascetic monk; his eyes were sunken, and
his closed lips bore a stern fixed expression, which scarcely softened
even when the sacrificial rite struck the notes of praise; and though
a light came into his eye, it was rather the devotion of one who had
offered himself, than the gleam of hopeful exultation.&nbsp; The horses
stood saddled at the west door, for Henry was feverishly eager to reach
Pontefract, where he had left his queen, and wished to avoid the delay
of breaking his fast at York, but only to snatch a meal at some country
hostel on his way.</p>
<p>Round the horses, however, a crowd of the citizens were collected
to gaze; and two or three women with children in their arms made piteous
entreaties for the King&rsquo;s healing touch for their little ones.&nbsp;
The kind Henry waited, ungloved his hand, asked his treasurer for the
gold pieces that were a much-esteemed part of the cure, and signed to
his attendant chaplain to say the Collect appointed for the rite.</p>
<p>Fervent blessings were meantime murmured through the crowd, which
broke out into loud shouts of &lsquo;God save King Harry!&rsquo; as
he at length leapt into the saddle; but at that moment, a feeble, withered
old man, leaning on a staff, and wearing a bedesman&rsquo;s gown, peered
up, and muttered to a comrade&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair-faced, quotha&mdash;fair, maybe, but not long for this
world!&nbsp; One is gone already, and the rest will not be long after;
the holy man&rsquo;s words will have their way&mdash;the death mark
is on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The words caught James&rsquo;s ear, and he angrily turned round:
&lsquo;Foul-mouthed raven, peace with thy traitor croak!&rsquo; but
Bedford caught his arm, crying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush! &rsquo;tis a mere bedesman;&rsquo; and bending forward
to pour a handful of silver into the beggar&rsquo;s cap, he said, &lsquo;Pray,
Gaffer, pray&mdash;pray for the dead and living, both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So,&rsquo; said James, as both mounted, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
a fee for a boding traitor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew his face,&rsquo; said Bedford, with a shudder; &lsquo;he
belonged to Archbishop Scrope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A traitor, too,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, there was too much cause for his words.&nbsp; Never shall
I forget the day when Scrope was put to death on this very moor on which
we are entering.&nbsp; There sat my father on his horse, with us four
boys around him, when the old man passed in front of us, and looked
at him with a face pitiful and terrible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Harry of Bolingbroke,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;because thou hast done these things, therefore shall
thy foes be of thine own household; the sword shall never depart therefrom,
but all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age,
and in the fourth generation shall their name be clean cut off.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The commons will have it that at that moment my father was struck with
leprosy; and struck to the heart assuredly he was, nor was he ever the
same man again.&nbsp; I always believed that those words made him harder
upon every prank of poor Hal&rsquo;s, till any son save Hal would have
become his foe!&nbsp; And see now, the old bedesman may be in the right;
poor pretty Blanche has long been in her grave, Thomas is with her now,
and Jamie,&rsquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice,&mdash;&lsquo;when men
say that Harry hath more of Alexander in him than there is in other
men, it strikes to my heart to think of the ring lying on the empty
throne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;what strikes <i>me</i> is,
what doleful bodings can come into a brave man&rsquo;s head on a chill
morning before he has broken his fast.&nbsp; A tankard of hot ale will
chase away omens, whether of bishop or bedesman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may chase them from the mind, but will not make away with
them,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I might have known better than
to speak to you of such things&mdash;you who are well-nigh a Lollard
in disbelief of all beyond nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No Lollard am I,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;What Holy
Church tells me, I believe devoutly; but not in that which she bids
me loathe as either craft of devils or of men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, of which?&nbsp; There lies the question,&rsquo; said John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of men,&rsquo; said the Scottish king; &lsquo;of men who have
wit enough to lay hold of the weaker side even of a sober youth such
as Lord John of Lancaster!&nbsp; Your proneness to believe in sayings
and prophecies, in sorceries and magic, is the weakest point of all
of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it is the weakest point in you, James, that you will not
credit upon proof, such proof as was the fulfilment of the prophecy
of the place of my father&rsquo;s death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One such saying as that, fulfilled to the ear, though not
in truth, is made the plea for all this heart-sinking&mdash;ay, and
what is worse, for the durance of your father&rsquo;s widow as a witch,
and of her brave young son, because forsooth his name is Arthur of Richemont,
and some old Welsh rhymester hath whispered to Harry that Richmond shall
come out of Brittany, and be king of England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arthur is no worse off than any other captive of Agincourt,&rsquo;
said Bedford; &lsquo;and I tell you, James, the day may come when you
will rue your want of heed to timely warnings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better rue once than pine under them all my life, and far
better than let them betray me into deeming some grewsome crime an act
of justice, as you may yet let them do,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>Such converse passed between the two princes, while King Henry rode
in advance, for the most part silent, and only desirous of reaching
Pontefract Castle, where he had left the young wife whose presence he
longed for the more in his trouble.&nbsp; The afternoon set in with
heavy rain, but he would not halt, although he gave free permission
to any of his suite to do so; and James recommended Malcolm to remain,
and come on the next day with Brewster.&nbsp; The boy, however, disclaimed
all weariness, partly because bashfulness made him unwilling to venture
from under his royal kinsman&rsquo;s wing, and partly because he could
not bear to let the English suppose that a Scotsman and a Stewart could
be afraid of weather.&nbsp; As the rain became harder with the evening
twilight, silence sank upon the whole troop, and they went splashing
on through the deep lanes, in mud and mire, until the lights of Pontefract
Castle shimmered on high from its hill.&nbsp; The gates were opened,
the horses clattered in, torches came forth, flickering and hissing
in the darkness.&nbsp; The travellers went through what seemed to Malcolm
an interminable number of courts and gateways, and at length flung themselves
off their horses, when Henry, striding on, mounted the steps, entered
the building, and, turning the corner of a great carved screen, he and
his brother, with James and Malcolm, found themselves in the midst of
a blaze of cressets and tapers, which lighted up the wainscoted part
of the hall.</p>
<p>The whole scene was dazzling to eyes coming in from the dark, and
only after a moment or two could Malcolm perceive that, close to the
great fire, sat a party of four, playing at what he supposed to be that
French game with painted cards of which Patrick Drummond had told him,
and that the rest seemed to be in attendance upon them.</p>
<p>Dark eyed and haired, with a creamy ivory skin, and faultless form
and feature, the fair Catherine would have been unmistakable, save that
as Henry hurried forward, the lights glancing on his jaded face, matted
hair, and soaked dress, the first to spring forward to meet him was
a handsome young man, who wrung his hand, crying, &lsquo;Ah, Harry,
Harry, then &rsquo;tis too true!&rsquo; while the lady made scarcely
a step forwards: no shade of colour tinged her delicate cheek; and though
she did not resist his fervent embrace, it was with a sort of recoil,
and all she was heard to say was, &lsquo;<i>Eh, Messire, vos bottes
sont crott&eacute;es</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know all, Kate?&rsquo; he asked, still holding her hand,
and looking afraid of inflicting a blow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The battle?&nbsp; Is it then so great a disaster?&rsquo; and,
seeing his amazed glance, &lsquo;The poor Messire de Clarence! it was
pity of him; he was a handsome prince.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, sweet, he held thee dear,&rsquo; said Henry, catching
at the crumb of sympathy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But yes,&rsquo; said Catherine, evidently perplexed by the
strength of his feeling, and repeating, &lsquo;He was a <i>beau sieur
courtois</i>.&nbsp; But surely it will not give the Armagnacs the advantage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With Heaven&rsquo;s aid, no!&nbsp; But how fares it with poor
Madge&mdash;his wife, I mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is away to her estates.&nbsp; She went this morn, and
wished to have taken with her the Demoiselle de Beaufort; but I forbade
that&mdash;I could not be left without one lady of the blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alack, Joan&mdash;&rsquo; and Henry was turning, but Catherine
interrupted him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have not spoken to Madame of Hainault,
nor to the Duke of Orleans.&nbsp; Nay, you are in no guise to speak
to any one,&rsquo; she added, looking with repugnance at the splashes
of mud that reached even to his waist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will don a fresh doublet, sweetheart,&rsquo; said Henry,
more rebuked than seemed fitting, &lsquo;and be ready to sup anon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Supper!&nbsp; We supped long ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may be; but we have ridden long since we snatched our
meal, that I might be with thee the sooner, my Kate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was not well in you, my Lord, to come in thus dishevelled,
steaming with wet&mdash;not like a king.&nbsp; You will be sick, my
Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little word of solicitude recalled his sweet tender smile of
gratitude.&nbsp; No fear, <i>ma belle</i>; sickness dares not touch
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;you will be served in
your chamber, and we will finish our game.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henry turned submissively away; but Bedford tarried an instant to
say, &lsquo;Fair sister, he is sore distressed.&nbsp; It would comfort
him to have you with him.&nbsp; He has longed for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine opened her beautiful brown eyes in a stare of surprise
and reproof at the infraction of the rules of ceremony which she had
brought with her.&nbsp; John of Bedford had never seemed to her either
<i>beau</i> or <i>courtois</i>, and she looked unutterable things, to
which he replied by an elevation of his marked eyebrows.</p>
<p>She sat down to her game, utterly ignoring the other princes in their
weather-beaten condition; and they were forced to follow the King, and
make their way to their several chambers, for Queen Catherine&rsquo;s
will was law in matters of etiquette.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The proud peat!&nbsp; She is jealous of every word Harry speaks&mdash;even
to his cousin,&rsquo; muttered James, as he reached his own room.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You saw her, though,&mdash;you saw her!&rsquo; he added, smiling,
as he laid his hand on Malcolm&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>The boy coloured like a poppy, and answered awkwardly enough, &lsquo;The
Lady Joan, Sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who but the Lady Joan, thou silly lad?&nbsp; How say&rsquo;st
thou?&nbsp; Will not Scotland forget in the sight of that fair face
all those fule phantasies&mdash;the only folly I heard at Glenuskie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Methinks,&rsquo; said Malcolm, looking down in sheer awkwardness,
&lsquo;it were easier to bow to her than to King Harry&rsquo;s dame.&nbsp;
She hath more of stateliness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;dost so serve thy courtly
&lsquo;prenticeship?&nbsp; Nay, but in a sort I see thy meaning.&nbsp;
The royal blood of England shows itself to one who hath an eye for princeliness
of nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Malcolm, gratified, &lsquo;those dark eyes
and swart locks&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dark eyes&mdash;swart locks!&rsquo; interrupted the King.&nbsp;
&lsquo;His wits have gone wool-gathering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Sir!&rsquo; exclaimed Malcolm, &lsquo;I thought you
meant the lady who stood by the Queen&rsquo;s table, with the grand
turn of the neck and the white wimple and veil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw!&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;the foolish callant! he hath
taken that great brown Luxemburg nun of Dame Jac&rsquo;s for the Rose
of Somerset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, James, seeing how confounded the boy was by this momentary
displeasure, explained to him who the other persons he had seen were&mdash;Jaqueline,
the runaway Countess of Hainault in her own right, and Duchess of Brabant
by marriage; Humfrey, duke of Gloucester, the King&rsquo;s young, brilliant
brother; the grave, melancholy Duke of Orleans, who had been taken captive
at Agincourt, and was at present quartered at Pontefract; the handsome,
but stout and heavy-looking Earl of March; brave Lord Warwick; Sir Lewis
Robsart, the old knight to whose charge the Queen had been specially
committed from the moment of her betrothal; and a young, bold, gay-looking
lad, of Malcolm&rsquo;s own age, but far taller and stouter, and with
a merry, half-defiant, half-insouciant air, who had greatly taken his
fancy, was, he was told, Ralf Percy, the second son of Sir Harry Percy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of him they called Hotspur?&mdash;who was taken captive at
Otterburn, who died a rebel!&rsquo; exclaimed Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;but King Harry had learnt the
art of war as a boy, first under Hotspur, in Wales; nor doth he love
that northern fashion of ours of keeping up feud from generation to
generation.&nbsp; So hath he restored the eldest son to his barony,
and set him to watch our Borders; and the younger, Ralf, he is training
in his own school of chivalry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More wonders for Malcolm Stewart, who had learnt to believe it mere
dishonour and tameness to forgive the son for his father&rsquo;s deeds.&nbsp;
A cloistered priest could hardly do so: pardon to a hostile family came
only with the last mortal throe; and here was this warlike king forgiving
as a mere matter of course!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; added James, &lsquo;you had best not speak of
your bent conventwards in the Court here.&nbsp; I should not like to
have you called the monkling!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm crimsoned, with the resolution never to betray himself.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V: WHITTINGTON S FEAST</h2>
<p>The next day the royal train set forth from Pontefract, and ere mounting,
James presented his young kinsman to the true Joan Beaufort&mdash;fair-haired,
soft-featured, blue-eyed, and with a lovely air of graciousness, as
she greeted him with a sweet, blushing, sunny smile, half that of the
queen in anticipation, half that of the kindly maiden wishing to set
a stranger at ease.&nbsp; So beautiful was she, that Malcolm felt annihilated
at the thought of his blunder of last night.</p>
<p>As they rode on, James was entirely occupied with the lady, and Malcolm
was a good deal left to himself; for, though the party was numerous,
he knew no one except the Duke of Bedford, who was riding with the King
and Lord Warwick, in deep consultation, while Sir Nigel Baird, Lord
Marmion, and the rest were in the rear.&nbsp; He fell into a mood of
depression such as had not come upon him since he passed the border,
thinking himself despised by all for being ill-favoured and ill-dressed,
and chafing, above all, at the gay contempt he fancied in young Ralf
Percy&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; He became constantly more discontented with
this noisy turmoil, and more resolved to insist on returning to the
peaceful cloister where alone he could hide his head and be at rest.</p>
<p>The troop halted for what they called their noon meat at the abode
of a hospitable Yorkshire knight; but King Henry, in order that the
good gentleman&rsquo;s means should not be overtasked, had given directions
that only the ladies and the princes should enter the house, while the
rest of the suite should take their meal at the village inn.</p>
<p>King James, in attending to Joan, had entirely forgotten his cousin;
and Malcolm, doubtful and diffident, was looking hesitatingly at the
gateway, when Ralf Percy called out, &lsquo;Ha! you there, this is our
way.&nbsp; That is only for the royal folk; but there&rsquo;s good sack
and better sport down here!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll show you the way,&rsquo;
he added, good-naturedly, softened, as most were, by the startled, wistful,
timid look.</p>
<p>Malcolm, ashamed to say he was royal, but surprised at the patronage,
was gratefully following, when old Bairdsbrae indignantly laid his hand
on the rein.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not so, Sir; this is no place for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me alone!&rsquo; entreated Malcolm, as he saw Percy&rsquo;s
amazed look and whistle of scorn.&nbsp; &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t want
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will never have your place if you do not take it,&rsquo;
said the old gentleman; and leading the trembling, shrinking boy up
to the door, he continued, &lsquo;For the honour of Scotland, Sir!&rsquo;
and then announcing Malcolm by his rank and title, he almost thrust
him in.</p>
<p>Fancying he detected a laugh on Ralf Percy&rsquo;s face, and a sneer
on that of the stout English porter, Malcolm felt doubly wretched as
he was ushered into the hall and the buzz of talk and the confusion
made by the attendance of the worthy knight and his many sons, one of
whom, waiting with better will than skill, had nearly run down the shy
limping Scotsman, who looked wildly for refuge at some table.&nbsp;
In his height of distress, a kindly gesture of invitation beckoned to
him, and he found himself seated and addressed, first in French, and
then in careful foreign English, by the same lady whom he had yesterday
taken for Joan of Somerset, namely, Esclairmonde de Luxemburg.</p>
<p>He was too much confused to look up till the piece of pasty and the
wine with which the lady had caused him to be supplied were almost consumed,
and it was not till she had made some observations on the journey that
he became at ease enough to hazard any sort of answer, and then it was
in his sweet low Scottish voice, with that irresistibly attractive look
of shy wistful gratitude in his great soft brown eyes, while his un-English
accent caused her to say, &lsquo;I am a stranger here, like yourself,
my Lord;&rsquo; and at the same moment he first raised his eyes to behold
what seemed to him perfect beauty and dignity, an oval face, richly-tinted
olive complexion, dark pensive eyes, a sweet grave mouth smiling with
encouraging kindness, and a lofty brow that gave the whole face a magnificent
air, not so much stately as above and beyond this world.&nbsp; It might
have befitted St. Barbara or St. Katherine, the great intellectual virgin
visions of purity and holiness of the middle ages; but the kindness
of the smile went to Malcolm&rsquo;s heart, and emboldened him to answer
in his best French, &lsquo;You are from Holland, lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not from the fens,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;My home
lies in the borders of the forest of Ardennes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then they found that they understood each other best when she
spoke French, and Malcolm English, or rather Scotch; and their acquaintance
made so much progress, that when the signal was again given to mount,
the Lady Esclairmonde permitted Malcolm to assist her to her saddle;
and as he rode beside her he felt pleased with himself, and as if Ralf
Percy were welcome to look at him now.</p>
<p>On Esclairmonde&rsquo;s other hand there rode a small, slight girl,
whom Malcolm took for quite a child, and paid no attention to; but presently
old Sir Lewis Robsart rode back with a message that my Lady of Westmoreland
wished to know where the Lady Alice Montagu was.&nbsp; A gentle, timid
voice answered, &lsquo;O Sir, I am well here with Lady Esclairmonde.&nbsp;
Pray tell my good lady so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And therewith Sir Lewis smiled, and said, &lsquo;You could scarcely
be in better hands, fair damsel,&rsquo; and rode back again; while Alice
was still entreating, &lsquo;May I stay with you, dear lady?&nbsp; It
is all so strange and new!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde smiled, and said, &lsquo;You make me at home here, Mademoiselle.&nbsp;
It is I who am the stranger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but you have been in Courts before.&nbsp; I never lived
anywhere but at Middleham Castle till they fetched me away to meet the
Queen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the gentle little maiden, a slender, fair-haired, childish-faced
creature, in her sixteenth year, was the motherless child and heiress
of the stout Earl of Salisbury, the last of the Montacutes, or Montagues,
who was at present fighting the King&rsquo;s battles in France, but
had sent his commands that she should be brought to Court, in preparation
for fulfilling the long-arranged contract between her and Sir Richard
Nevil, one of the twenty-two children of the Earl of Westmoreland.</p>
<p>She was under the charge of the Countess&mdash;a stately dame, with
all the Beaufort pride; and much afraid of her she was, as everything
that was shy or forlorn seemed to turn towards the maiden whose countenance
not only promised kindness but protection.</p>
<p>Presently the cavalcade passed a gray building in the midst of green
fields and orchards, where, under the trees, some black-veiled figures
sat spinning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A nunnery!&rsquo; quoth Esclairmonde, looking eagerly after
it as she rode past.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A nunnery!&rsquo; said Malcolm, encouraged into the simple
confidingness of a young boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;How unlike the one where
my sister is!&nbsp; Not a tree is near it; it is perched upon a wild
crag overhanging the angry sea, and the winds roar, and the gulls and
eagles scream, and the waves thunder round it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet it is not the less a haven of peace,&rsquo; replied Esclairmonde.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Verily,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;one knows what peace is
under that cloister, where all is calm while the winds rave without.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know how to love a cloister,&rsquo; said the lady, as
she heard his soft, sad tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had promised myself to make my home in one,&rsquo; said
Malcolm; &lsquo;but my King will have me make trial of the world first.&nbsp;
And so please you,&rsquo; he added, recollecting himself, &lsquo;he
forbade me to make my purpose known; so pray, lady, be so good as to
forget what I have said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will be silent,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde; &lsquo;but I will
not forget, for I look on you as one like myself, my young lord.&nbsp;
I too am dedicated, and only longing to reach my cloistered haven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke it out with the ease of those days when the monastic was
as recognized a profession as any other calling, and yet with something
of the desire to make it evident on what ground she stood.</p>
<p>Lady Alice uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, &lsquo;I was dedicated his
my infancy, and promised myself in the nunnery at Dijon when I was seven
years old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if to turn the conversation from herself, she asked of Malcolm
if he too had made any vow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to myself,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Neither
my Tutor nor the Prior of Coldingham would hear my vows.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he was soon drawn into telling his whole story, to which the ladies
both listened with great interest and kindness, Esclairmonde commending
his resolution to leave the care of his lands and vassals to one whom
he represented as so much better fitted to bear them as Patrick Drummond,
and only regretting the silence King James had enjoined, saying she
felt that there was safety and protection in being avowed as a destined
religious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are one,&rsquo; said Lady Alice, looking at her in
wonder.&nbsp; &lsquo;And yet you are with <i>that</i> lady&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
And the girl&rsquo;s innocent face expressed a certain wonder and disgust
that no one could marvel at who had heard the Flemish Countess talk
in the loudest, broadest, most hoydenish style.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has been my very good lady,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde;
&lsquo;she has, under the saints, saved me from much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I entreat you, tell us, dear lady!&rsquo; entreated Alice.&nbsp;
It was not a reticent age.&nbsp; Malcolm Stewart had already avowed
himself in his own estimation pledged to a monastic life, and Esclairmonde
of Luxemburg had reasons for wishing her position and intentions to
be distinctly understood by all with whom she came in contact; moreover,
there was a certain congeniality in both her companions, their innocence
and simplicity, that drew out confidence, and impelled her to defend
her lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor Countess,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;she has been sorely
used, and has suffered much.&nbsp; It is a piteous thing when our little
imperial fiefs go to the spindle side!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are her lands?&rsquo; asked Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hainault, Holland, and Zealand,&rsquo; replied the lady.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Her father was Count of Hainault, her mother the sister of the
last Duke of Burgundy&mdash;him that was slain on the bridge of Montereau.&nbsp;
She was married as a mere babe to the Duke of Touraine, who was for
a brief time Dauphin, but he died ere she was sixteen, and her father
died at the same time.&nbsp; Some say they both were poisoned.&nbsp;
The saints forfend it should be true; but thus it was my poor Countess
was left desolate, and her uncle, the Bishop of Li&eacute;ge&mdash;Jean
Sans Piti&eacute;, as they call him&mdash;claimed her inheritance.&nbsp;
You should have seen how undaunted she was!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you with her then?&rsquo; asked Alice Montagu.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I had been taken from our convent at Dijon, when
my dear brothers, to whom Heaven be merciful! died at Azincourt.&nbsp;
My <i>oncles &agrave; la mode de Bretagne</i>&mdash;how call you it
in English?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Welsh uncles,&rsquo; said Alice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are the Count de St. Pol and the Bishop of Th&eacute;rouenne.&nbsp;
They came to Dijon.&nbsp; In another month I should have been seventeen,
and been admitted as a novice; but, alack! there were all the lands
that came through my grandmother, in Holland and in Flanders, all falling
to me, and Monseigneur of Th&eacute;rouenne, like almost all secular
clergy, cannot endure the religious orders, and would not hear of my
becoming a Sister.&nbsp; They took me away, and the Bishop declared
my dedication null, and they would have bestowed me in marriage at once,
I believe, if Heaven had not aided me, and they could not agree on the
person.&nbsp; And then my dear Countess promised me that she would never
let me be given without my free will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;the Bishop did cancel your
dedication?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde; &lsquo;but none can cancel
the dedication of my heart.&nbsp; So said the holy man at Zwoll.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How, lady?&rsquo; anxiously inquired Malcolm; &lsquo;has not
a bishop power to bind and unloose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, &lsquo;such power that if my
childish promise had been made without purpose or conscience thereof,
or indeed if my will were not with it, it would bind me no more, there
were no sin in wedlock for me, no broken vow.&nbsp; But my own conscience
of my vow, and my sense that I belong to my Heavenly Spouse, proved,
he said, that it was not my duty to give myself to another, and that
whereas none have a parent&rsquo;s right over me, if I have indeed chosen
the better part, He to whom I have promised myself will not let it be
taken from me, though I might have to bear much for His sake.&nbsp;
And when I said in presumption that such would lie light on me, he bade
me speak less and pray more, for I knew not the cost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must have been a very holy man,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;and
strict withal.&nbsp; Who was he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One Father Thomas, a Canon Regular of the chapter of St. Agnes,
a very saint, who spends his life in copying and illuminating the Holy
Scripture, and in writing holy thoughts that verily seem to have been
breathed into him by special inspiration of God.&nbsp; It was a sermon
of his in Lent, upon chastening and perplexity, that I heard when first
I was snatched from Dijon, that made me never rest till I had obtained
his ghostly counsel.&nbsp; If I never meet him again, I shall thank
Heaven for those months at Zwoll all my life&mdash;ere the Duke of Burgundy
made my Countess resign Holland for twelve years to her uncle, and we
left the place.&nbsp; Then, well-nigh against her will, they forced
her into a marriage with the Duke of Brabant, though he be her first
cousin, her godson, and a mere rude boy.&nbsp; I cannot tell you how
evil were the days we often had then.&nbsp; If he had been left to himself,
Madame might have guided him; but ill men came about him; they maddened
him with wine and beer; they excited him to show that he feared her
not; he struck her, and more than once almost put her in danger of her
life.&nbsp; Then, too, his mother married the Bishop of Li&eacute;ge,
her enemy&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Bishop!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had never been consecrated, and had a dispensation.&nbsp;
That marriage deprived my poor lady of even her mother&rsquo;s help.&nbsp;
All were against her then; and for me too it went ill, for the Duke
of Burgundy insisted on my being given to a half-brother of his, one
they call Sir Bo&euml;mond of Burgundy&mdash;a hard man of blood and
revelry.&nbsp; The Duke of Brabant was all for him, and so was the Duchess-mother;
and though my uncles would not have chosen him, yet they durst not withstand
the Duke of Burgundy.&nbsp; I tried to appeal to the Emperor Sigismund,
the head of our house, but I know not if he ever heard of my petition.&nbsp;
I was in an exceeding strait, and had only one trust, namely, that Father
Thomas had told me that the more I threw myself upon God, the more He
would save me from man.&nbsp; But oh! they seemed all closing in on
me, and I knew that Sir Bo&euml;mond had sworn that I should pay heavily
for my resistance.&nbsp; Then one night my Countess came to me.&nbsp;
She showed me the bruises her lord had left on her arms, and told me
that he was about to banish all of us, her ladies, into Holland, and
to keep her alone to bear his fury, and she was resolved to escape,
and would I come with her?&nbsp; It seemed to me the message of deliverance.&nbsp;
Her nurse brought us peasant dresses, high stiff caps, black boddices,
petticoats of many colours, and therein we dressed ourselves, and stole
out, ere dawn, to a church, where we knelt till the Sieur d&rsquo;Escaillon&mdash;the
gentleman who attends Madame still&mdash;drove up in a farmer&rsquo;s
garb, with a market cart, and so forth from Bruges we drove.&nbsp; We
cause to Valenciennes, to her mother; but we found that she, by persuasion
of the Duke, would give us both up; so the Sieur d&rsquo;Escaillon got
together sixty lances, and therewith we rode to Calais, where never
were weary travellers more courteously received than we by Lord Northumberland,
the captain of Calais.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am glad you came to us English!&rsquo; cried Alice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Only I would it had been my father who welcomed you.&nbsp; And
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I remain with my lady, as the only demoiselle she has
from her country; and, moreover, I am waiting in the trust that my kinsmen
will give up their purpose of bestowing me in marriage, now that I am
beyond their reach; and in time I hope to obtain sufficient of my own
goods for a dowry for whatever convent I may enter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, let it be an English one!&rsquo; cried Alice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have learnt to breathe freer since I have been on English
soil,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, smiling; &lsquo;but where I may rest
at last, Heaven only knows!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a strange country,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
one seems afraid of violence and wrong here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that so strange?&rsquo; asked Alice, amazed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
men would be hanged if they did violence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would we were as sure of justice at my home,&rsquo; sighed
Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;King Henry will bring about a better rule.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never doubt,&rsquo; cried Salisbury&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When France is once subdued, there will be no more trouble, he
will make your kinsmen do you right, dear demoiselle, and oh! will you
not found a beauteous convent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;King Henry has not conquered France yet,&rsquo; was all Esclairmonde
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; cried the buxom Countess Jaqueline, as the ladies
dismounted, &lsquo;never speak to me more, our solemn sister.&nbsp;
When have I done worse than lure a young cavalier, and chain him all
day with my tongue?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a gentle boy!&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truly he looked like a calf turned loose among strange cattle!&nbsp;
How gat he into the hall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is of royal Scottish blood,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde &lsquo;cousin-german
to King James.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And our grave nun has a fancy to tame the wild Scots, like
a second St. Margaret!&nbsp; A king&rsquo;s grandson! fie, fie! what,
become ambitious, Clairette?&nbsp; Eh? you were so occupied, that I
should have been left to no one but Monseigneur of Gloucester, but that
I was discreet, and rode with my Lord Bishop of Winchester.&nbsp; How
he chafed! but I know better than to have <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>
with young sprigs of the blood royal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde laughed good-humouredly, partly in courtesy to her hoyden
mistress, but partly at the burning, blushing indignation she beheld
in the artless face of Alice Montagu.</p>
<p>The girl was as shy as a fawn, frightened at every word from knight
or lady, and much in awe of her future mother-in-law, a stiff and stately
dame, with all the Beaufort haughtiness; so that Lady Westmoreland gladly
and graciously consented to the offer of the Demoiselle de Luxemburg
to attend to the little maiden, and let her share her chamber and her
bed.&nbsp; And indeed Alice Montagu, bred up in strictness and in both
piety and learning, as was sometimes the case with the daughters of
the nobility, had in all her simplicity and bashfulness a purity and
depth that made her a congenial spirit with the grave votaress, whom
she regarded on her side with a young girl&rsquo;s enthusiastic admiration
for a grown woman, although in point of fact the years between them
were few.</p>
<p>The other ladies of the Court were a little in awe of the Demoiselle
de Luxemburg, and did not seek her when they wished to indulge in the
gossip whose malice and coarseness she kept in check; but if they were
anxious, or in trouble, they always came to her as their natural consoler;
and the Countess Jaqueline, bold and hoydenish as she was, kept the
license of her tongue and manners under some shadow of restraint before
her, and though sometimes bantering her, often neglecting her counsel,
evidently felt her attendance a sort of safeguard and protection.</p>
<p>The gentlemen were mostly of the opinion of the Duke of Gloucester,
who said that the Lady Esclairmonde was so like Deborah, come out of
a Mystery, that it seemed to be always Passion-tide where she was; and
she, moreover, was always guarded in her manner towards them, keeping
her vocation in the recollection of all by her gravely and coldly courteous
demeanour, and the sober hues and fashion of her dress; but being aware
of Malcolm&rsquo;s destination, perceiving his loneliness, and really
attracted by his pensive gentleness, she admitted him to far more friendly
intercourse than any other young noble, while he revered and clung to
her much as Lady Alice did, as protector and friend.</p>
<p>King James was indeed so much absorbed in his own lady-love as to
have little attention to bestow on his young cousin, and he knew, moreover,
that to be left to such womanly training as ladies were bound to bestow
on young squires and pages was the best treatment for the youth, who
was really thriving and growing happier every day, as he lost his awkwardness
and acquired a freedom and self-confidence such as he could never have
imagined possible in his original brow-beaten state, though without
losing the gentle modesty and refinement that gave him such a charm.</p>
<p>A great sorrow awaited him, however, at Leicester, where Easter was
to be spent.&nbsp; A messenger came from Durham, bringing letters from
Coldingham to announce the death of good Sir David Drummond, which had
taken place two days after Malcolm had left him, all but the youth himself
having well known that his state was hopeless.</p>
<p>In his grief, Malcolm found his chief comforter in Esclairmonde,
who kindly listened when he talked of the happy old times at Glenuskie,
and of the kindness and piety of his guardian; while she lifted his
mind to dwell on the company of the saints; and when he knew that her
thoughts went, like his, to his fatherly friend in the solemn services
connected with the departed, he was no longer desolate, and there was
almost a sweetness in the grief of which his fair saint had taken up
a part.&nbsp; She showed him likewise some vellum pages on which her
ghostly father, the Canon of St. Agnes, had written certain dialogues
between the Divine Master and His disciple, which seemed indeed to have
been whispered by heavenly inspiration, and which soothed and hallowed
his mourning for the guide and protector of his youth.&nbsp; He loved
to dwell on her very name, Esclairmonde&mdash;&lsquo;light of the world.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The taste of the day hung many a pun and conceit upon names, and to
Malcolm this&mdash;which had, in fact, been culled out of romance&mdash;seemed
meetly to express the pure radiance of consolation and encouragement
that seemed to him to shine from her, and brighten the life that had
hitherto been dull and gloomy&mdash;nay, even to give him light and
joy in the midst of his grief.</p>
<p>At that period Courts were not much burdened with etiquette.&nbsp;
No feudal monarch was more than the first gentleman, and there was no
rigid line of separation of ranks, especially where, as among the kings
of the Red Rose, the boundaries were so faint between the princes and
the nobility; and as Catherine of Valois was fond of company, and indolently
heedless of all that did not affect her own dignity or ease, the whole
Court, including some of the princely captives, lived as one large family,
meeting at morning Mass in church or chapel, taking their meals in common,
riding, hunting, hawking, playing at bowls, tennis, or stool-ball, or
any other pastime, in such parties as suited their inclinations; and
spending the evening in the great hall, in conversation varied by chess,
dice, and cards, recitals of romance, and music, sometimes performed
by the choristers of the Royal chapel, or sometimes by the company themselves,
and often by one or other of the two kings, who were both proficients
as well with the voice as with the lute and organ.</p>
<p>Thus Malcolm had many opportunities of being with the Demoiselle
of Luxemburg: and almost a right was established, that when she sat
in the deep embrasure of a window with her spinning, he should be on
the cushioned step beneath; when she mounted, he held the stirrup; and
when the church bells were ringing, he led her by her fair fingers to
her place in the nave, and back again to the hall; and when the manchet
and rere supper were brought into the hall, he mixed her wine and water,
and held the silver basin and napkin to her on bended knee, and had
become her recognized cavalier.&nbsp; He was really thriving.&nbsp;
Even the high-spirited son of Hotspur could not help loving and protecting
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have a care,&rsquo; said Ralf to a lad of ruder mould; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
no more see that lame young Scot maltreated than a girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is no better than a girl,&rsquo; growled his comrade; &lsquo;my
little brother Dick would be more than a match for him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wot not that,&rsquo; said Percy; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a
drop of life and spirit at the bottom; and for the rest, when he looks
up with those eyes of his, and smiles his smile, it is somehow as if
it were beneath a man to vex him wilfully.&nbsp; And he sees so much
meaning in everything, too, that it is a dozen times better sport to
hear him talk than one of you fellows, who have only wit enough to know
a hawk from a heron-schaw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a grave Easter-tide spent at Leicester, the Court moved to
Westminster, where Henry had to meet his parliament, and obtain supplies
for the campaign which was to revenge the death of Clarence.</p>
<p>There was no great increase of gaiety even here, for Henry was extremely
occupied, both with regulating matters for government during his absence,
and in training the troops who began to flock to his standard; so that
the Queen complained that his presence in England was of little service
to her, since he never had any leisure, and there were no pastimes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Dame,&rsquo; said Henry, gaily, &lsquo;there is one
revel for you.&nbsp; I have promised to knight the Lord Mayor, honest
Whittington, and I hear he is preparing a notable banquet in the Guild
Hall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A city mayor!&rsquo; exclaimed Queen Catherine, with ineffable
disgust.&nbsp; &lsquo;My brothers would sooner cut off his <i>roturier</i>
head than dub him knight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Belike,&rsquo; said Henry, dryly; &lsquo;but what kind of
friends have thy brothers found at Paris?&nbsp; Moreover, this Whittington
may content thee as to blood.&nbsp; Rougedragon hath been unfolding
to me his lineage of a good house in Gloucestershire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More shame that he should soil his hands with trade!&rsquo;
said the Queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See what you say when he has cased those fair hands in Spanish
gloves.&nbsp; You ladies should know better than to fall out with a
mercer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Duke Humfrey, &lsquo;they never saw the silks
and samites wherewith he fitted out my sister Philippa for the Swedes!&nbsp;
Lucky the bride whose wardrobe is purveyed by honest Dick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it not honour enough for the mechanical hinds that we wear
their stuffs,&rsquo; said Countess Jaqueline, &lsquo;without demeaning
ourselves to eat at their boards?&nbsp; The <i>outrecuidance</i> of
the rogues in the Netherlands would be surpassing, did we feed it in
that sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis you that will be fed, Dame Jac,&rsquo; laughed
Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can tell you, their sack and their pasties, their
march-pane and blanc-manger, far exceed aught that a poor soldier can
set before you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Moreover,&rsquo; observed Humfrey, &lsquo;the ladies ought
to see the romaunt of the Cat complete.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How!&rsquo; cried Jaqueline, &lsquo;is it, then, true that
this Vittentone is the miller&rsquo;s son whose cat wore boots and made
his fortune?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard my aunt of Orleans divert my father with that
story,&rsquo; murmured Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;How went the tale?&nbsp;
I thought it folly, and marked it not.&nbsp; What became of the cat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cat desired to test his master&rsquo;s gratitude, so tells
Straparola,&rsquo; said the Duke of Orleans, in his dry satirical tone;
&lsquo;and whereas he had been wont to promise his benefactor a golden
coffin and state funeral, Puss feigned death, and thereby heard the
lady inform her husband that the old cat was dead.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>A
la bonne heure</i>!&rdquo; said the Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take him by
the tail, and fling him on the muck-heap beneath the window!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thereof I acquit Whittington, who never was thankless to man
or brute,&rsquo; said King Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Moreover, his cat, or
her grandchildren, must be now in high preferment at the King of Barbary&rsquo;s
Court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A marvellous beast is that cat,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
I was a child in Scotland, we used to tell the story of her exchange
for a freight of gold and spices, only the ship sailed from Denmark,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;but I would maintain the
truth of Whittington&rsquo;s cat with my lance, and would gladly have
no worse cause!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see his cat painted beside him in
the Guild Hall, and may hear the tale from him, as I loved to hear him
when I was a lad.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Turn again, Whittington,<br />
Thrice Lord Mayor of London town!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I told my good old friend I must have come over from France on purpose
to keep his third mayoralty.&nbsp; So I am for the City on Thursday;
and whoever loves good wine, good sturgeon, good gold, or good men,
had best come with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such inducements were not to be neglected, and though Queen Catherine
minced and bridled, and apologized to Duchess Jaqueline for her husband&rsquo;s
taste for low company, neither princess wished to forego the chance
of amusement; and a brilliant cavalcade set forth in full order of precedence.&nbsp;
The King and Queen were first; then, to his great disgust, the King
of Scots, with Duchess Jaqueline; Bedford, with Lady Somerset; Gloucester,
with the Countess of March; the Duke of Orleans, with the Countess of
Exeter; and Malcolm of Glenuskie found himself paired off with his sovereign&rsquo;s
lady-love, Joan Beaufort, and a good deal overawed by the tall horned
tower that crowned her flaxen locks, as well as by knowing that her
uncle, the Bishop of Winchester, the stateliest, stiffest, and most
unapproachable person in all the Court, was riding just behind him,
beside the Demoiselle de Luxemburg.</p>
<p>Temple Bar was closed, and there was a flourish of trumpets and a
parley ere the gate was flung open to admit the royal guests; but Malcolm,
in his place, could not see the aldermen on horseback, in their robes
of scarlet and white, drawn up to receive the King.&nbsp; All that way
up Holborn, every house was hung with tapestry, and the citizens formed
a gorgeously-apparelled lane, shouting in unison, their greetings attuned
to bursts of music from trumpets and nakers.</p>
<p>Beautiful old St. Paul&rsquo;s, with the exquisite cross for open-air
preaching in front, rose on their view; and before the lofty west door
the princely guests dismounted, each gentleman leading his lady up the
nave to the seat prepared in such manner that he might be opposite to
her.&nbsp; The clergy lined the stalls, and a magnificent mass was sung,
and was concluded by the advance of the King to the altar step, followed
by a fine old man in scarlet robes bordered with white fur, the collar
of SS. round his neck, and his silvery hair and lofty brow crowning
a face as sagacious as it was dignified and benevolent.</p>
<p>It seemed a reversal of the ordinary ceremonial when the slender
agile young man took in hand the sword, and laid the honour of knighthood
on the gray-headed substantial senior, whom he bade to arise Sir Richard
Whittington.&nbsp; Jaqueline of Hainault had the bad taste to glance
across to Humfrey and titter, but the Duke valued popularity among the
citizens, and would not catch her eye; and in the line behind the royal
ladies there was a sweet elderly face, beautiful, though time-worn,
with blue eyes misty with proud glad tears, and a mouth trembling with
tender exultation.</p>
<p>After the ceremony was concluded, King Henry offered his hand to
the Lady Mayoress, Dame Alice Whittington, making her bright tears drop
in glad confusion at his frank, hearty congratulation and warm praise
of her husband; and though the fair Catherine could have shuddered when
Sir Richard advanced to lead her, she was too royal to compromise her
dignity by visible scorn, and she soon found that the merchant could
speak much better French than most of the nobles.</p>
<p>Malcolm felt as averse as did the French princesses to burgher wealth
and splendour, and his mind had not opened to understand burgher worth
and weight; and when he saw the princes John and Humfrey, and even his
own king, seeking out city dames and accosting them with friendly looks,
it seemed to him a degrading truckling to riches, from which he was
anxious to save his future queen; but when he would have offered his
arm to Lady Joan, he saw her already being led away by an alderman measuring
at least a yard across the shoulders; and the good-natured Earl of March,
seeing him at a loss, presented him to a round merry wife in a scarlet
petticoat and black boddice, its plump curves wreathed with geld chains,
who began pitying him for having been sent to the wars so young, being,
as usual, charmed into pity by his soft appealing eyes and unconscious
grace; would not believe his assertions that he was neither a captive
nor a Frenchman;&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t tell her, when he spoke like
a stranger, and halted from a wound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Colouring to the ears, he explained that he had never walked otherwise;
whereupon her pity redoubled, and she by turns advised him to consult
Master Doctor Caius, and to obtain a recipe from Mistress&mdash;she
meant Dame&mdash;Alice Whittington, the kindest soul living, and, Lady
Mayoress as she was, with no more pride than the meanest scullion.&nbsp;
Pity she had no child&mdash;yet scarce pity either, since she and the
good Lord Mayor were father and mother to all orphans and destitute&mdash;nay,
to all who had any care on their minds.</p>
<p>Malcolm was in extreme alarm lest he should be walked up to the Lady
Mayoress for inspection before all the world when they entered the Guild
Hall, a building of grand proportions, which, as good Mistress Bolt
informed him, had lately been paved and glazed at Sir Richard Whittington&rsquo;s
own expense.&nbsp; The bright new red and yellow tiles, and the stained
glass of the tall windows high up, as well as the panels of the wainscot,
were embellished with trade-marks and the armorial bearings of the guilds;
and the long tables, hung with snowy napery, groaned with gold and silver
plate, such as, the Duke of Orleans observed to Catherine, no citizens
would dare exhibit in France to any prince or noble, at peril of being
mulcted of all, with or without excuse.</p>
<p>On an open hearth beneath the louvre, or opening for smoke, burnt
a fire diffusing all around an incense-like fragrance, from the logs,
composed of cinnamon and other choice woods and spices, that fed the
flame.&nbsp; The odour and the warmth on a bleak day of May were alike
delicious; and King Henry, after heading Dame Alice up to it, stood
warming his hands and extolling the choice scent, adding: &lsquo;You
spoil us, Sir Richard.&nbsp; How are we to go back to the smoke of wood
and peat, and fires puffed with our own mouths, after such pampering
as this&mdash;the costliest fire I have seen in the two realms?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It shall be choicer yet, Sir,&rsquo; said Sir Richard Whittington,
who had just handed the Queen to her seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scarce possible,&rsquo; replied Henry, &lsquo;unless I threw
in my crown, and that I cannot afford.&nbsp; I shall be pawning it ere
long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead of answering, the Lord Mayor quietly put his hand into his
furred pouch, and drawing out a bundle of parchments tied with a ribbon,
held them towards the King, with a grave smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lo you now, Sir Richard,&rsquo; said Henry, with a playful
face of disgust; &lsquo;this is to save your dainty meats, by spoiling
my appetite by that unwelcome sight.&nbsp; What, man! have you bought
up all the bonds I gave in my need to a whole synagogue of Jews and
bench of Loin-bards?&nbsp; I shall have to send for my crown before
you let me go; though verily,&rsquo; he added, with frank, open face,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m better off with a good friend like you for my creditor&mdash;only
I&rsquo;m sorry for you, Sir Richard.&nbsp; I fear it will be long ere
you see your good gold in the stead of your dirty paper, even though
I gave you an order on the tolls.&nbsp; How now!&nbsp; What, man, Dick
Whittington!&nbsp; Art raving?&nbsp; Here, the tongs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For Sir Richard, gently smiling, had placed the bundle of bonds on
the glowing bed of embers.</p>
<p>Henry, even while calling for the tongs, was raking them out with
his sword, and would have grasped them in his hand in a moment, but
the Lord Mayor caught his arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon, my lord, and grant your new knight&rsquo;s boon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When he is not moon-struck!&rsquo; said Henry, still guarding
the documents.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, my Lady Mayoress, know you what is
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sixty thousand, my liege,&rsquo; composedly answered Dame
Alice.&nbsp; &lsquo;My husband hath his whims, and I pray your Grace
not to hinder what he hath so long been preparing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, Sir,&rsquo; added Whittington, earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
wot that God hath prospered us richly.&nbsp; We have no child, and our
nephews are well endowed.&nbsp; How, then, can our goods belong to any
save God, our king, and the poor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henry drew one hand over his eyes, and with the other wrung that
of Whittington.&nbsp; &lsquo;Had ever king such a subject?&rsquo; he
murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had ever subject such a king?&rsquo; was Whittington&rsquo;s
return.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou hast conquered, Whittington,&rsquo; said the King, presently
looking up with a sunny smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;To send me over the seas
a free man, beholden to you in heart though not by purse, is, as I well
believe, worth all that sum to thy loyal heart.&nbsp; Thou art setting
me far on my way to Jerusalem, my dear friend!&nbsp; Thank him, Kate&mdash;he
hath done much for thine husband!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine looked amiable, and held out a white hand to be kissed,
aware that the King was pleased, though hardly understanding why he
should be glad that an odour of singed parchment should overpower the
gums and cinnamon.&nbsp; This was soon remedied by the fresh handful
of spices that were cast into the flame, and the banquet began, magnificent
with peacocks, cranes, and swans in full plumage; the tusky bear crunched
his apple, deer&rsquo;s antlers adorned the haunch, the royal sturgeon
floated in wine, fountains of perfumed waters sprang up from shells,
towers of pastry and of jelly presented the endless allegorical devices
of medi&aelig;val fancy, and, pre-eminent over all, a figure of the
cat, with emerald eyes, fulfilled, as Henry said, the proverb, &lsquo;A
cat might look at a king;&rsquo; and truly the cat and her master had
earned the right; therefore his first toast was, &lsquo;To the Cat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each guest found at his or her place a beautiful fragrant pair of
gloves, in Spanish leather, on the back of which was once more embroidered,
in all her tabby charms, the cat&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Therewith began
a lengthy meal; and Malcolm Stewart rejoiced at finding himself seated
next to the Lady Esclairmonde, but he grudged her attention to her companion,
a slender, dark, thoughtful representative of the Goldsmiths&rsquo;
Company, to whom she talked with courtesy such as Malcolm had scorned
to show his city dame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, presently, &lsquo;was a dame
in a religious garb whom I marked near the door here?&nbsp; She hooked
like one of the B&eacute;guines of my own country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have no such order here, lady,&rsquo; said the goldsmiths,
puzzled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey, Master Price,&rsquo; cried Mistress Bolt, speaking across
Malcolm, &lsquo;I can tell the lady who it was.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas good
Sister Avice Rodney, to whom the Lady Mayoress promised some of these
curious cooling drinks for the poor shipwright who hath well-nigh cloven
off his own foot with his axe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, truly,&rsquo; returned the goldsmith; &lsquo;it must
have been one of the bedeswomen of St. Katharine&rsquo;s whom the lady
has seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What order may that be?&rsquo; asked Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have seen nothing so like my own country since I came hither.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may well be, madam,&rsquo; said Mistress Belt, &lsquo;seeing
that these bedeswomen were first instituted by a countrywoman of your
own&mdash;Queen Philippa, of blessed memory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By your leave, Mistress Bolt,&rsquo; interposed Master Price,
&lsquo;the hospital of St. Katharine by the Tower is of far older foundation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By <i>your</i> leave, sir, I know what I say.&nbsp; The hospital
was founded I know not when, but these bedeswomen were especially added
by the good Queen, by the same token that mine aunt Cis, who was tirewoman
to the blessed Lady Joan, was one of the first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How was it?&nbsp; What is their office?&rsquo; eagerly inquired
Esclairmonde.&nbsp; And Mistress Bolt arranged herself for a long discourse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, fair sirs and sweet lady, though you be younger than
I, you have surely heard of the Black Death.&nbsp; Well named was it,
for never was pestilence more dire; and the venom was so strong, that
the very lips and eyelids grew livid black, and then there was no hope.&nbsp;
Little thought of such disease was there, I trow, in kings&rsquo; houses,
and all the fair young lords and ladies, the children of King Edward,
as then was, were full of sport and gamesomeness as you see these dukes
be now.&nbsp; And never a one was blither than the Lady Joan&mdash;she
they called Joan of the Tower, being a true Londoner born&mdash;bless
her!&nbsp; My aunt Cis would talk by the hour of her pretty ways and
kindly mirth.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas even as the children have the game
in the streets&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There come three knights all out of Spain,<br />
Are come to fetch your daughter Jane.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&rsquo;Twas for the King of Castille, that same Peter for whom the
Black Prince of Wales fought, and of whom such grewsome tales were told.&nbsp;
The pretty princess might almost have had a boding what sort of husband
they had for her, for she begged and prayed, even on her knees, that
her father would leave her; but her sisters were all espoused, and there
was no help for it.&nbsp; But, as one comfort to her, my aunt Cis, who
had been about her from her cradle, was to go with her; and oft she
would tell of the long journey in litters through France, and how welcome
were the English tongues they heard again at Bordeaux, and how when
poor Lady Joan saw her brother, the Prince, she clung about his neck
and sobbed, and how he soothed her, and said she would soon laugh at
her own unwillingness to go to her husband.&nbsp; But even then the
Black Death was in Bordeaux, and being low and mournful at heart, the
sweet maid contracted it, and lay down to die ere she had made two days&rsquo;
journey, and her last words were, &ldquo;My God hath shown me more pity
than father or brother;&rdquo; and so she died like a lamb, and mine
aunt was sent by the Prince to bear home the tidings to the good Queen,
who was a woeful woman.&nbsp; And therewith, here was the pestilence
in London, raging among the poor creatures that lived in the wharves
and on the river bank, in damp and filth, so that whole households lay
dead at once, and the contagion, gathering force, spread into the city,
and even to the nobles and their ladies.&nbsp; Then my good aunt, having
some knowledge of the sickness already, and being without fear, went
among the sick, and by her care, and the food, wine, and clothing she
brought, saved a many lives.&nbsp; And from whom should the bounties
come, save from the good Queen, who ever had a great pity for those
touched like her own fair child?&nbsp; Moreover, when she heard from
my aunt how the poor things lived in uncleanness and filth, and how,
what with many being strangers coming by sea, and others being serfs
fled from home, they were a nameless, masterless sort, who knew not
where to seek a parish priest, and whom the friars shunned for their
poverty, she devised a fresh foundation to be added to the hospital
of St. Katharine&rsquo;s in the Docks, providing for a chapter of ten
bedeswomen, gentle and well-nurtured, who should both sing in choir,
and likewise go forth constantly among the poor, to seek out the children,
see that they learn their Credo, Ave, and Pater Noster, bring the more
toward to be further taught in St. Katharine&rsquo;s school, and likewise
to stir poor folk up to go to mass and lead a godly life; to visit the
sick, feed and tend them, and so instruct them, that they may desire
the Sacraments of the Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! good Flemish Queen!&rsquo; cried Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
learnt that of our B&eacute;guines!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If your ladyship will have it so,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bolt; &lsquo;but
my aunt Cicely began!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who nominates these bedeswomen?&rsquo; asked Esclairmonde.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That does the Queen,&rsquo; said Mistress Bolt.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not
this young Queen, as yet, for Queen Joan, the late King&rsquo;s widow,
holds the hospital till her death, unless it should be taken from her
for her sorceries, from which Heaven defend us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can it be visited?&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
feel much drawn thither, as I ever did to the B&eacute;guines.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, marry may it!&rsquo; cried delighted Mrs. Bolt.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have more than one gossip there, foreby Sister Avice, who was
godchild to Aunt Cis; and if the good lady would wish to see the hospital,
I would bear her company with all my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To Malcolm&rsquo;s disgust, Esclairmonde caught at the proposal,
which the Scottish haughtiness that lay under all his gentleness held
somewhat degrading to the cousin of the Emperor.&nbsp; He fell into
a state of gloom, which lasted till the loving-cup had gone round and
been partaken of in pairs.</p>
<p>After hands had been washed in rose-water, the royal party took their
seats in barges to return to Westminster by the broad and beautiful
highway of the Thames.</p>
<p>Here at once Alice Montagu nestled to Esclairmonde&rsquo;s side,
delighted with her cat gloves, and further delighted with an old captain
of trained bands, to whose lot she had fallen, and who, on finding that
she was the daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, under whom he had served,
had launched forth by the hour into the praises of that brave nobleman,
both for his courage and his kindness to his troops.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No wonder King Henry loves his citizens so well!&rsquo; cried
Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would that our Netherlandish princes and
burghers could take pride and pleasure in one another&rsquo;s wealth
and prowess, instead of grudging and fearing thereat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To my mind,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;they were a forward
generation.&nbsp; That city dame will burst with pride, if you, lady,
go with her to see those bedeswomen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust not,&rsquo; laughed Esclairmonde, &lsquo;for I mean
to try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, but,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;what should a mere matter
of old rockers and worn-out tirewomen concern a demoiselle of birth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I honour them for doing their Master&rsquo;s work,&rsquo;
said Esclairmonde, &lsquo;and would fain be worthy to follow in their
steps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;there are houses fit for
persons of high and princely birth to live apart from gross contact
with the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde; &lsquo;but I trust I
may be pardoned for saying that such often seem to me to play at humility
when they stickle for birth and dower with the haughtiest.&nbsp; I never
honoured any nuns so much as the humble Sisters of St. Begga, who never
ask for sixteen quarterings, but only for a tender hand, soft step,
pure life, and pious heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I deemed,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;that heavenly contemplation
was the purpose of convents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even so, for such as can contemplate like the holy man I have
told you of,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde; &lsquo;but labour hath been greatly
laid aside in convents of late, and I doubt me if it be well, or if
their prayers be the better for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;I heard my Lord of Winchester
saying how it were well to suppress the alien priories, and give their
wealth to found colleges like that founded by Bishop Wykeham.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For in truths the spirit of the age was beginning to set against
monasticism.&nbsp; It was the period when perhaps there was more of
license and less of saintliness than at any other, and when the long
continuance of the Great Schism had so injured Church discipline that
the clergy and ecclesiastics were in the worst state of all, especially
the monastic orders, who owned no superior but the Pope, and between
the two rivals could avoid supervision altogether.&nbsp; Such men as
Thomas &agrave; Kempis, or the great Jean Gerson, were rare indeed;
and the monasteries had let themselves lose their missionary character,
and become mere large farms, inhabited by celibate gentlemen and their
attendants, or by the superfluous daughters of the nobles and gentry.&nbsp;
Such devotion as led Esclairmonde to the pure atmosphere of prayer and
self-sacrifice had well-nigh died out, and almost every other lady of
the time would have regarded her release from the vows made for her
its her babyhood a happy escape.</p>
<p>Still less, at a time when no active order of Sisters, save that
of the B&eacute;guines in Holland, had been invented, and when no nun
ever dreamt of carrying her charity beyond the quadrangle of her own
convent, could any one be expected to enter into Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
admiration and longing for out-of-door works; but the person whom she
had chiefly made her friend was the King&rsquo;s almoner and chaplain,
sometimes called Sir Martin Bennet, at others Dr. Bennet, a great Oxford
scholar, bred up among William of Wykeham&rsquo;s original seventy at
Winchester and New College, and now much trusted and favoured by the
King, whom he everywhere accompanied.&nbsp; That Sir Martin was a pluralist
must be confessed, but he was most conscientious in providing substitutes,
and was a man of much thought and of great piety, in whom the fair pupil
of the Canon of St. Agnes found a congenial spirit.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI: MALCOLM&rsquo;S SUIT</h2>
<p>&lsquo;That is a gentle and gracious slip of the Stewart.&nbsp; What
shall you do with him?&rsquo; asked King Henry of James, as they stood
together at one end of the tilt-yard at Westminster, watching Malcolm
Stewart and Ralf Percy, who were playing at closhey, the early form
of nine-pins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what I should like to do,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What may that be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To marry him to the Lady Esclairmonde de Luxemburg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henry gave a long whistle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you other views for her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I!&nbsp; Am I to have designs on every poor dove who flies
into my tent from the hawk?&nbsp; Besides, are not they both of them
vowed to a religious life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither vow is valid,&rsquo; replied James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To meddle with such things is what I should not <i>dare</i>,&rsquo;
said Henry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monks and friars are no such holy beings, that I should greatly
concern me about keeping an innocent had out of their company,&rsquo;
said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor do I say they are,&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;but it is
ill to cross a vow of devotion, and to bring a man back to the world
is apt to render him not worth the having.&nbsp; You may perchance get
him down lower than you intended.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This boy never had any real vocation at all,&rsquo; said James;
&lsquo;it was only the timidity born of ill-health, and the longing
for food for the mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maybe so,&rsquo; replied the English king, &lsquo;and you
may be in the right; but why fix on that grand Luxemburg wench, who
ought to be a Lady Abbess of Fontainebleau at least, or a very St. Hilda,
to rule monks and nuns alike?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they have fixed on each other.&nbsp; Malcolm needs
a woman like her to make a man of him; and with her spirit and fervent
charity, we should have them working a mighty change in Scotland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you get her there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have I your consent, Harry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no affair of mine!&nbsp; You must settle
it with Madame of Hainault; but you had best take care.&nbsp; You are
more like to make your tame lambkin into a ravening wolf, than to get
that Deborah the prophetess to herd him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James in sooth viewed this warning as another touch of Lancastrian
superstition, and only considered how to broach the question.&nbsp;
Malcolm, meantime, was balancing between the now approaching decision
between Oxford and France.&nbsp; He certainly felt something of his
old horror of warlike scenes; but even this was lessening; he was aware
that battles were not every-day occurrences, and that often there was
no danger at all.&nbsp; He would not willingly be separated from his
king; and if the female part of the Court were to accompany the campaign,
it would be losing sight of all he cared for, if he were left among
a set of stranger shavelings at Oxford.&nbsp; Yet he was reluctant to
break with the old habits that had hitherto been part of his nature;
he felt, after every word of Esclairmonde&mdash;nay, after every glance
towards her&mdash;as though it were a blessed thing to have, like her,
chosen the better part; he knew she would approve his resort to the
home of piety and learning; he was aware that when with Ralf Percy and
the other youths of the Court he was ashamed of his own scrupulousness,
and tempted to neglect observances that they might call monkish and
unmanly; and he was not at all sure that in face of the enemy a panic
might not seize him and disgrace him for ever!&nbsp; In effect he did
not know what he wished, even when he found that the Queen had decided
against going across the sea, and that therefore all the ladies would
remain with her at Shene or Windsor.</p>
<p>He should probably never again see Esclairmonde, the guiding star
of his recent life, the embodiment of all that he had imagined when
conning the quaint old English poems that told the Legend of Seynct
Katharine; and as he leant musingly against a lattice, feeling as if
the brightness of his life was going out, King James merrily addressed
him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh! the fit is on you too, boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What fit, Sir?&rsquo;&nbsp; Malcolm opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The pleasing madness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm uttered a cry like horror, and reddened crimson.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir!&nbsp;
Sir!&nbsp; Sir!&rsquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A well-known token of the disease is raving.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, Sir!&nbsp; I implore you to speak of nothing so profane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not given to profanity,&rsquo; said James, endeavouring
to look severe, but with laughter in his voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Methought
you were not yet so sacred a personage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Myself!&nbsp; No; but that I&mdash;I should dare to have such
thoughts of&mdash;oh, Sir!&rsquo; and Malcolm covered his face with
his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, that you should have so mistaken me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have <i>not</i> mistaken you,&rsquo; said James, fixing
his keen eyes on him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Sir!&rsquo; cried Malcolm, like one freshly stung, &lsquo;you
have!&nbsp; Never, never dreamt I of aught but worshipping as a living
saint, as I would entreat St. Margaret or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was still the King&rsquo;s steady look and the suppressed smile.&nbsp;
Malcolm broke off, and with a sudden agony wrung his hands together.&nbsp;
The King still smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, Malcolm, it will not do; you
are man, not monk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why be so cruel as to make me vile in my own eyes?&rsquo;
almost sobbed Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;she is not a saint in
heaven, nor a nun in a convent, but a free woman, to be won by the youth
she has marked out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marked!&nbsp; Oh, Sir, she only condescended because she knew
my destination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is well,&rsquo; said King James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thus sparks
kindle at unawares.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm&rsquo;s groan and murmur of &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; made James
almost laugh at the evidence that on one side at least the touch-wood
was ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Sir,&rsquo; he sighed, &lsquo;why put the thought before
me, to make me wretched!&nbsp; Even were she for the world, she would
never be for me.&nbsp; I&mdash;doited&mdash;hirpling&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Peace, silly lad; all that is past and gone.&nbsp; You are
quite another now, and a year or two of Harry&rsquo;s school of chivalry
will send you home a gallant knight and minstrel, such as no maiden
will despise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King went, and Malcolm fell into a silent state of musing.&nbsp;
He was entirely overpowered, both by the consciousness awakened within
himself, by the doubt whether it were not a great sin, and by the strangeness
that the King, hitherto his oracle, should infuse such a hope.&nbsp;
What King James deemed possible could never be so incredible, or even
sacrilegious, as he deemed it.&nbsp; Restless, ashamed, rent by a thousand
conflicting feelings, Malcolm roamed up and down his chamber, writhed,
tried to sit and think, then, finding his thoughts in a whirl, renewed
his frantic pacings.&nbsp; And when dire necessity brought him again
into the ladies&rsquo; chamber, he was silent, blushing, ungainly, abstracted,
and retreated into the farthest possible corner from the unconscious
Esclairmonde.</p>
<p>Then, when again alone with the King, he began with the assertion,
&lsquo;It is utterly impossible, Sir;&rsquo; and James smiled to see
his poison working.&nbsp; Not that he viewed it as poison.&nbsp; Monasticism
was at a discount, and the ranks of the religious orders were chiefly
filled, the old Benedictine and Augustinian foundations by gentlemen
of good family who wanted the easy life of a sort of bachelor squire,
and the friaries were recruited by the sort of men who would in modern
times be dissenting teachers of the lower stamp.&nbsp; James was persuaded
that Malcolm was fit for better things than were usually to be seen
in a convent, and that it was a real kindness not to let him merely
retire thither out of faintness of heart, mistaken for devotion; and
he also felt as if he should be doing good service, not only to Malcolm,
but to Scotland, if he could obtain for him a wife of the grand character
of Esclairmonde de Luxemburg.</p>
<p>He even risked the mention of the project to the Countess of Hainault,
without whose consent nothing could be effected.&nbsp; Jaqueline laughed
long and loud at the notion of her stately Esclairmonde being the lady-love
of King James&rsquo;s little white-visaged cousin; but if he could bring
it about she had no objection, she should be very glad that the demoiselle
should come down from the height and be like other people; but she would
wager the King of Scots her emerald carcanet against his heron&rsquo;s
plume, that Esclairmonde would never marry unless her hands were held
for her.&nbsp; Was she not at that very moment visiting some foundation
of bedeswomen&mdash;that was all she heard of at yonder feast of cats!</p>
<p>In fact, under Dr. Bennet&rsquo;s escort, Esclairmonde and Alice
were in a barge dropping down the Thames to the neighbourhood of the
frowning fortress of the Tower&mdash;as yet unstained; and at the steps
leading to the Hospitium of St. Katharine the ladies were met, not only
by their friend Mrs. Bolt, but by Sir Richard Whittington, his kindly
dame, and by &lsquo;Master William Kedbesby,&rsquo; a grave and gentle-looking
old man, who had been Master of St. Katharine&rsquo;s ever since the
first year of King Richard II., and delighted to tell of the visits
&lsquo;Good Queen Anne&rsquo; of Bohemia had made to her hospital, and
the kind words she had said to the old alms-folk and the children of
the schools; and when he heard that the Lady Esclairmonde was of the
same princely house of Luxemburg, he seemed to think no honour sufficient
for her.&nbsp; They visited the two houses, one for old men, the other
for old women, each with a common apartment, with a fire, and a dining-table
in the midst, and sleeping cells screened off round it, and with a paved
terrace walk overhanging the river, where the old people could sit and
sun themselves, and be amused by the gay barges and the swans that expatiated
there.&nbsp; The bedeswomen, ten in number, had a house arranged like
an ordinary nunnery, except that they were not in seclusion, had no
grating, and shared the quadrangle with the alms-folk and children.&nbsp;
They were gentle and well-nurtured women, chiefly belonging to the city
and country families that furnished servants to the queens; and they
applied themselves to various offices of charity, going forth into the
city to tend the poor, and to teach the women and children.&nbsp; The
appointments of alms-folk and admissions to the school were chiefly
made at their recommendation; and though a master taught all the book-learning
in the busy hive of scholars&mdash;eighty in number&mdash;one or more
of them instructed the little girls in spinning and in stitchery, to
say nothing of gentle and modest demeanour.&nbsp; There was a great
look of happiness and good order about all; and the church, fair and
graceful, seemed well to complete and rule the institution.&nbsp; Esclairmonde
could but sigh with a sort of regret as she left it, and let herself
be conducted by Sir Richard Whittington to a refection at his beautiful
house in Crutched Friars, built round a square, combining warehouse
and manor-house; richly-carved shields, with the arms of the companies
of London, supporting the tier of first-floor windows, and another row
of brackets above supporting another overhanging story.&nbsp; A fountain
was in the centre of a beautiful greensward, with beds of roses, pansies,
pinks, stars of Bethlehem, and other good old flowers, among which a
monkey was chained to a tree, while a cat roamed about at a safe distance
from him.</p>
<p>Alice Montagu raised a laugh by asking if it were <i>the</i> cat;
to which her city namesake replied that &lsquo;her master&rsquo; never
could abide to be without a cat in memory of his first friend, and marshalled
them into the beautiful hall, with wainscot lining below, surmounted
by an arcade containing statues, and above a beautiful carved ceiling.&nbsp;
Here a meal was served to them, and the Lady talked with Whittington
of the grand town-halls and other buildings of the merchants of the
Low Countries, with whom he was a trader for their rich stuffs; and
the visit passed off with no small satisfaction to both parties.</p>
<p>Esclairmonde sat in the barge on her return, looking out on the gray
clear water, and on the bright gardens that sloped down to it, gay with
roses and fruitful with mulberries, apples, and strawberries, and the
mansions and churches that were never quite out of sight, though there
were some open fields and wild country ere coming to Westminster, all
as if she did not see them, but was wrapped in deep contemplation.</p>
<p>Alice at last, weary of silence, stole her arm round her waist, and
peeped up into her face.&nbsp; &lsquo;May I guess thy thoughts, sweet
Clairette?&nbsp; Thou wilt found such a hospice thyself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say not I <i>will</i>, child,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, with
a crystal drop starting in each dark eye.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would strive
and hope, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! thou wilt, thou wilt,&rsquo; cried Alice; &lsquo;and since
there are B&eacute;guines enough for their own Netherlands, thou wilt
come to England and be our foundress here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, little one; here are the bedeswomen of St. Katharine&rsquo;s
in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but we have other cities.&nbsp; Good Father, have we not?&nbsp;
Hull&mdash;Southampton&mdash;oh! so many, where poor strangers come
that need ghostly tendance as well as bodily.&nbsp; Esclairmonde&mdash;Light
of the World&mdash;oh! it was not for nothing that they gave thee that
goodly name.&nbsp; The hospice shall bear it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush! sweet pyet; mine own name is what they must not
bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but the people will give it; and our Holy Father the Pope,
he will put thee into the canon of saints.&nbsp; Only pity that I cannot
live to hear of Ste. Esclairmonde&mdash;nay, but then I must overlive
thee, mind I should not love that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, silence, silence, child; these are no thoughts to begin
a work with.&nbsp; Little flatterer, it may be well for me that our
lives must needs lie so far apart that I shall not oft hear that fond
silly tongue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Alice, in the luxury, not of castle-building
but of convent-building; &lsquo;it may be that when that knight over
there sees me so small and ill-favoured he will none of me, and then
I&rsquo;ll thank him so, and pray my father to let him have all my lands
and houses except just enough to dower me to follow thee with, dear
Lady Prioress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But here Alice was summarily silenced.&nbsp; Such talk, both priest
and votaress told her, was not meet for dutiful daughter or betrothed
maiden.&nbsp; Her lot was fixed, and she must do her duty therein as
the good wife and lady of the castle, the noble English matron; and
as she looked half disposed to pout, Esclairmonde drew such a picture
of the beneficent influence of the good baronial dame, ruling her castle,
bringing up her children and the daughters of her vassals in good and
pious nurture, making &lsquo;the heart of her husband safely trust in
her,&rsquo; benefiting the poor, and fostering holy men, wayfarers,
and pilgrims, that the girl&rsquo;s eyes filled within tears as she
looked up and said, &lsquo;Ah! lady, this is the life fitted for thee,
who can paint it so well.&nbsp; Why have I not a brother, that you might
be Countess of Salisbury, and I a poor little sister in a nunnery?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Silly child, <i>petite
n&iuml;aise</i>, our lots were fixed by other hands than ours.&nbsp;
We will strive each to serve our God, in the coif or in the veil, in
samite or in serge, and He will only ask which of us has been most faithful,
not whether we have lived in castle or in cloister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Little had Esclairmonde expected to hear the greeting with which
the Countess received her, breaking out into peals of merriment as she
told her of the choice destiny in store for her, to be wedded to the
little lame Scot, pretending to read her a grave lecture on the consequences
of the advances she had made to him.</p>
<p>Esclairmonde was not put out of countenance; in fact, she did not
think the Countess in earnest, and merely replied with a smile that
at least there was less harm in Lord Malcolm than in the suitors at
home.</p>
<p>Jaqueline clapped her hands and cried, &lsquo;Good tidings, Clairette.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll never forgive you if you make me lose my emerald carcanet!&nbsp;
So the arrow was winged, after all.&nbsp; She prefers him&mdash;her
heart is touched by the dainty step.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madame!&rsquo; entreated Esclairmonde, with agitation; &lsquo;at
least, infirmity should be spared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It touches her deeply!&rsquo; exclaimed the Duchess.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah! to see her in the mountains teaching the wild men to say
their Aye, and to wear <i>culottes</i>, the little prince interpreting
for her, as King James told us in his story of the saint his ancestor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Raillery about Malcolm had been attempted before, but never so pertinaciously;
and Esclairmonde heeded it not at all, till James himself sought her
out, and, within all his own persuasive grace, told her that he was
rejoiced to hear from Madame of Hainault that she had spoken kindly
of his youthful kinsman, for whose improvement he was sure he had in
great measure to thank her.</p>
<p>Esclairmonde replied composedly, but as one on her guard, that the
Sieur de Glenuskie was a gentle and a holy youth, of a good and toward
wit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I saw from the first,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;when I
brought him away from being crushed among our rude cousins; but, lady,
I knew not how the task of training the boy would be taken out of my
hands by your kindness; and now, pardon me, lady, only one thing is
wanting to complete your work, and that is hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hope is always before a holy man, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, madame! but we peer earthly beings require an earthly hope,
nearer home, to brace our hearts, and nerve our arms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought the Sieur de Glenuskie was destined to a religious
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never by any save his enemies, lady.&nbsp; The Regent Albany
and his fierce sons have striven to scare Malcolm into a cloister, that
his sister and his lands may be their prey; and they would have succeeded
had not I come to Scotland in time.&nbsp; The lad never had any true
vocation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may be,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, somewhat sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still,&rsquo; added James, &lsquo;he is of a thoughtful and
somewhat tender mould, and the rudeness of life will try him sorely
unless he have some cheering star, some light of love, to bear him up
and guide him on his way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If so, may he find a worthy one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady, it is too late to talk of what he may find.&nbsp; The
brightness that has done so much for him already will hinder him from
turning his eyes elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a minstrel, Sir King, and therefore these words of
light romance fall from your lips.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, lady, hitherto my romance has been earnest.&nbsp; It
rests with you to make Malcolm&rsquo;s the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so, Sir.&nbsp; That has long been out of my hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madame, you might well shrink from what it was as insult to
you to propose; but have you never thought of the blessings you might
confer in the secular life, with one who would be no hindrance, but
a help?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Sir, for no blessings, but curses, would follow a breach
of dedication.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady, I will not press you with what divines have decided
respecting such dedication.&nbsp; Any scruples could be removed by the
Holy Father at Rome, and, though I will speak no further, I will trust
to your considering the matter.&nbsp; You have never viewed it in any
light save that of a refuge from wedlock with one to whom I trust you
would prefer my gentle cousin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It were a poor compliment to Lord Malcolm to name him in the
same day with Sir Bo&euml;mond of Burgundy,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde;
&lsquo;but, as I said, it is not the person that withholds me, but the
fact that I am not free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not ask you to love or accept the poor boy as yet,&rsquo;
said James; &lsquo;I leave that for the time when I shall bring him
back to you, with the qualities grown which you have awakened.&nbsp;
At least, I can bear him the tidings that it is not your feelings, but
your scruples that are against him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir King,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, gravely, &lsquo;I question
not your judgment in turning your kinsman and subject to the secular
life; but if you lead him by false hopes, of which I am the object,
I tell you plainly that you are deluding him; and if any evil come thereof,
be it on your own head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She moved away, with a bend of her graceful neck, and James stood
with a slight smile curving his lip.&nbsp; &lsquo;By my troth,&rsquo;
he said to himself, &lsquo;a lordly lady!&nbsp; She knows her own vocation.&nbsp;
She is one to command scores of holy maids, and have all the abbots
and priors round at her beck, instead of one poor man.&nbsp; Rather
Malcolm than I!&nbsp; But he is the very stuff that loves to have such
a woman to rule him; and if she wed at all, he is the very man for her!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not give it up!&nbsp; Love is the way to make a man of him,
whether successful or not, and she may change her mind, since she is
not yet on the roll of saints.&nbsp; If I could get a word with her
father confessor, and show him how much it would be for the interest
of the Church in Scotland to get such a woman there, it would be the
surest way of coming at her.&nbsp; Were she once in Scotland, my pretty
one would have a stay and helper!&nbsp; But all must rest till after
the campaign.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James therefore told Malcolm so much as that he had spoken to his
lady-love for him, and that she had avowed that it was not himself,
but her own vows, that was the obstacle.</p>
<p>Malcolm crimsoned with joy as well as confusion; and the King proceeded:
&lsquo;For the vows&rsquo;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&lsquo;we
knew there is a remedy!&nbsp; Meantime, Malcolm, be you a man, win your
spurs, and show yourself worth overcoming something for!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm smiled and brightened, holding his head high and joyously,
and handling his sword.&nbsp; Then came the misgiving&mdash;&lsquo;But
Lilias, Sir, and Patrick Drummond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will provide for them, boy.&nbsp; You know Drummond is
bent on carving his own fortune rather than taking yours, and that your
sister only longs to see you a gallant knight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was true, but Malcolm sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have not spoken to the lady yourself?&rsquo; asked the
King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Sir.&nbsp; Oh, how can I?&rsquo; faltered Malcolm, shamefaced
and frightened.</p>
<p>James laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let that be as the mood takes you, or
occasion serves,&rsquo; he said, wondering whether the lad&rsquo;s almost
abject awkwardness and shame would be likely to create the pity akin
to love or to contempt, and deciding that it must be left to chance.</p>
<p>Nor did Malcolm find boldness enough to do more than haunt Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
steps, trembling if she glanced towards him, and almost shrinking from
her gaze.&nbsp; He had now no doubts about going on the campaign, and
was in full course of being prepared with equipments, horses, armour,
and attendants, as became a young prince attending on his sovereign
as an adventurer in the camp.&nbsp; It was not even worth while to name
such scruples to the English friar who shrived him on the last day before
the departure, and who knew nothing of his past history.&nbsp; He knew
all priests would say the same things, and as he had never made a binding
vow, he saw no need of consulting any one on the subject; it would only
vex him again, and fill him with doubts.&nbsp; The suspicion that Dr.
Bennet was aware of his previous intention made him shrink from him.&nbsp;
So the last day had come, and all was farewell.&nbsp; King Henry had
persuaded the Queen to seclude herself for one evening from Madame of
Hainault, for his sake.&nbsp; King James was pacing the gardens on the
Thames banks, with Joan Beaufort&rsquo;s hand for once allowed to repose
in his; many a noble gentleman was exchanging last words with his wife&mdash;many
a young squire whispering what he had never ventured to say before&mdash;many
a silver mark was cloven&mdash;many a bright tress was exchanged.&nbsp;
Even Ralf Percy was in the midst of something very like a romp with
the handsome Bessie Nevil for a knot of ribbon to carry to the wars.</p>
<p>Malcolm felt a certain exaltation in being enough like other people
to have a lady-love, but there was not much comfort otherwise; indeed,
he could so little have addressed Esclairmonde that it was almost a
satisfaction that she was the centre of a group of maidens whose lovers
or brothers either had been sent off beforehand, or who saw their attentions
paid elsewhere, and who all alike gravitated towards the Demoiselle
de Luxemburg for sympathy.&nbsp; He could but hover on the outskirts,
conscious that he must cut a ridiculous figure, but unable to detach
himself from the neighbourhood of the magnet.&nbsp; As he looked back
on the happy weeks of unconstrained intercourse, when he came to her
as freely as did these young girls with all his troubles, he felt as
if the King had destroyed all his joy and peace, and yet that these
flutterings of heart and agonies of shame and fits of despair were worth
all that childish calm.</p>
<p>He durst say nothing, only now and then to gaze on her with his great
brown wistful eyes, which he dropped whenever she looked towards him;
until at last, when the summer evening was closing in, and the last
signal was given for the break-up of the party, Malcolm ventured on
one faltering murmur, &lsquo;Lady, lady, you are not offended with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, kindly; &lsquo;nothing has
passed between us that should offend me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His eye lighted.&nbsp; &lsquo;May I still be remembered in your prayers,
lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I shall remember all who have been my friends here,&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And oh, lady, if I should&mdash;should win honour, may I lay
it at your feet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever you achieve as a good man and true will gladden me,&rsquo;
said Esclairmonde, &lsquo;as it will all others that wish you well.&nbsp;
Both you and your sister in her loneliness shall have my best prayers.&nbsp;
Farewell, Lord Malcolm; may the Saints bless and guard you, whether
in the world or the Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm knew why she spoke of his sister, and felt as if there were
no hope for him.&nbsp; Esclairmonde&rsquo;s grave kindness was a far
worse sign than would have been any attempt to evade him; but at any
rate she had spoken with him, and his heart could not but be cheered.&nbsp;
What might he not do in the glorious future?&nbsp; As the foremost champion
of a crusading king, bearing St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross through the very
gates of Jerusalem, what maiden, however saintly, could refuse him his
guerdon?</p>
<p>And he knew that, for the present, Esclairmonde was safe from retiring
into any convent, since her high birth and great possessions would make
any such establishment expect a large dower with her as a right, and
few abbesses would have ventured to receive a runaway foreigner, especially
as one of her guardians was the Bishop of Th&eacute;rouenne.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII: THE SIEGE OF MEAUX</h2>
<p>Wintry winds and rains were sweeping over the English tents on the
banks of the Marne, where Henry V. was besieging Meaux, then the stronghold
of one of those terrible freebooters who were always the offspring of
a lengthened war.&nbsp; Jean de Gast, usually known as the Bastard de
Vaurus, nominally was of the Armagnac or patriotic party, but, in fact,
pillaged indiscriminately, especially capturing travellers on their
way to Paris, and setting on their heads a heavy price, failing which
he hung them upon the great elm-tree in the market-place.&nbsp; The
very suburbs of Paris were infested by the forays of this desperate
<i>routier</i>, as such highway robbers were called; the supplies of
previsions were cut off, and the citizens had petitioned King Henry
that he would relieve them from so intolerable an enemy.</p>
<p>The King intended to spend the winter months with his queen in England,
and at once attacked the place in October, hoping to carry it by a <i>coup
de main</i>.&nbsp; He took the lower city, containing the market-place
and several large convents, with no great difficulty; but the upper
city, on a rising ground above the river, was strongly fortified, well
victualled, and bravely defended, and he found himself forced to invest
it, and make a regular siege, though at the expense of severe toil and
much sickness and suffering.&nbsp; Both his own prestige in France and
the welfare of the capital depended on his success, and he had therefore
fixed himself before Meaux to take it at whatever cost.</p>
<p>The greater part of the army were here encamped, together with the
chief nobles, March, Somerset, Salisbury, Warwick, and likewise the
King of Scots.&nbsp; James had for a time had the command of the army
which besieged and took Dreux while Henry was elsewhere engaged, but
in general he acted as a sort of volunteer aide-de-camp to his brother
king, and Malcolm Stewart of Glenuskie was always with him as his squire.&nbsp;
A great change had come over Malcolm in these last few months.&nbsp;
His feeble, sickly boyhood seemed to have been entirely cast off, and
the warm genial summer sun of France to have strengthened his frame
and developed his powers.&nbsp; He had shot up suddenly to a fair height,
had almost lost his lameness, and gained much more appearance of health
and power of enduring fatigue.&nbsp; His nerves had become less painfully
sensitive, and when after his first skirmish, during which he had kept
close to King James, far too much terrified to stir an inch from him,
he had not only found himself perfectly safe, but had been much praised
for his valour, he had been so much pleased with himself that he quite
wished for another occasion of displaying his bravery; and, what with
use, and what with the increasing spirit of pugnacity, he was as sincere
as Ralf Percy in abusing the French for never coming to a pitched battle.&nbsp;
Perhaps, indeed, Malcolm spoke even more eagerly than Ralf, in his own
surprise and gratification at finding himself no coward, and his fear
lest Percy should detect that he ever had been supposed to be such.</p>
<p>So far the King of Scots had succeeded in awakening martial fire
in the boy, but he found him less the companion in other matters than
he had intended.&nbsp; When at Paris, James would have taken him to
explore the learned hoards of the already venerable University of Paris,
where young James Kennedy&mdash;son to Sir James Kennedy of Dunure,
and to Mary, an elder sister of the King&mdash;was studying with exceeding
zeal.&nbsp; Both James and Dr. Bennet were greatly interested in this
famous abode of hearing&mdash;the King, indeed, was already sketching
out designs in his own mind for a similar institution in Scotland, designs
that were destined to be carried out after his death by Kennedy; and
Malcolm perforce heard many inquiries and replies, but he held aloof
from friendship with his clerkly cousin Kennedy, and closed his ears
as much as might be, hanging back as if afraid of returning to his books.&nbsp;
There was in this some real dread of Ralf Percy&rsquo;s mockery of his
clerkliness, but there was more real distaste for all that appertained
to the past days that he now despised.</p>
<p>The tide of vitality and physical vigour, so long deficient, had,
whom it had fairly set in, carried him away with it: and in the activity
of body newly acquired, mental activity had well-nigh ceased.&nbsp;
And therewith went much of the tenderness of conscience and devout habits
of old.&nbsp; They dropped from him, sometimes for lack of time, sometimes
from false shame, and by and by from very weariness and distaste.&nbsp;
He was soldier now, and not monk&mdash;ay, and even the observances
that such soldiers as Henry and James never failed in, and always enforced,
were becoming a burthen to him.&nbsp; They wakened misgivings that he
did not like, and that must wait till his next general shrift.</p>
<p>And Esclairmonde?&nbsp; Out of her sight, Malcolm dreamt a good deal
about her, but more as the woman, less as the saint; and the hopes,
so low in her presence, burnt brighter in her absence as Malcolm grew
in self-confidence and in knowledge of the world.&nbsp; He knew that
when he parted with her he had been a miserable little wretch whom any
woman would despise, yet she had shown him a sort of preference; how
would it be when he returned to her, perhaps a knight, certainly a brave
man like other men!</p>
<p>Of Patrick Drummond he had as yet heard nothing, and only believed
him to be among the Scots who fought on the French side under the Earls
of Buchan and Douglas.&nbsp; Indeed, James especially avoided places
where he knew these Scots to be engaged, as Henry persisted in regarding
them as rebels against him, and in hanging all who were made prisoners;
nor had Malcolm, during the courtesies that always pass between the
outposts of civilized armies, made much attempt to have any communication
with his cousin, for though his own abnegation of his rights had never
been permitted by his guardian, or reckoned on by his sister or her
lover, still he had been so much in earnest about it himself, as, while
regarding it as a childish folly, to feel ill at ease in the remembrance,
and, though defiant, willing to avoid all that could recall it.</p>
<p>Meantime he, with his king, was lodged in a large old convent, as
part of the immediate following of King Henry.&nbsp; Others of the princes
and nobles were quartered in the market hall and lower town, but great
part of thine troops were in tents, and in a state of much discomfort,
owing to the overflowings of the Marne.&nbsp; Fighting was the least
of their dangers, though their skirmishes were often fought ankle-deep
in mud and mire; fever and ague were among them, and many a sick man
was sent away to recover or die at Paris.&nbsp; The long dark evenings
were a new trial to men used to summer campaigning, and nothing but
Henry&rsquo;s wonderful personal influence and perpetual vigilance kept
up discipline.&nbsp; At any hour of the day or night, at any place in
the camp, the King might be at hand, with a cheery word of sympathy
or encouragement, or with the most unflinching sternness towards any
disobedience or debauchery&mdash;ever a presence to be either loved
or dreaded.&nbsp; An engineer in advance of his time, he was persuaded
that much of the discomfort might be remedied by trenching the ground
around the camp; but this measure proved wonderfully distasteful to
the soldiery.&nbsp; How hard they laboured in the direct siege operations
they cared not, but to be set to drain French fields seemed to them
absurd and unreasonable, and the work would not have proceeded at all
without constant superintendence from one of the chiefs of the army,
since the ordinary knights and squires were as obstinately prejudiced
as were the men.</p>
<p>Thus it was that, on a cold sleety December day, James of Scotland
rode along the meadows, splashing through thin ice into muddy water,
and attended by his small personal suite, excepting Sir Nigel Baird,
who was gone on a special commission to Paris.&nbsp; Both he and Malcolm
were plainly and lightly armed, and wore long blue cloaks with the St.
Andrew&rsquo;s cross on the shoulder, steel caps without visors, and
the King&rsquo;s merely distinguished by a thread-hike circlet of gold.&nbsp;
They had breastplates, swords, and daggers, but they were not going
to a quarter where fighting was to be expected, and bright armour was
not to be exposed to rust without need.&nbsp; A visit of inspection
to the delvers was not a congenial occupation, for though the men-at-arms
had obeyed James fairly well when he was in sole command at Dreux, yet
whenever he was obliged to enforce anything unpopular, the national
dislike to the Scot was apt to show itself, and the whole army was at
present in a depressed condition which made such manifestations the
more probable.</p>
<p>But King Henry was not half recovered from a heavy feverish cold,
which he had not confessed or attended to, and he had also of late been
troubled with a swelling of the neck.&nbsp; This morning, too, much
to his inconvenience and dismay, he had missed his signet-ring.&nbsp;
The private seal on such a ring was of more importance than the autograph
at that time, and it would never have left the King&rsquo;s hand; but
no doubt, in consequence of his indisposition, his finger, always small-boned,
had become thin enough to allow the signet to escape unawares, he was
unwilling to publish the loss, as it might cast doubt on the papers
he despatched, and he, with his chamberlain Fitzhugh, King James, Malcolm,
Percy, and a few more, had spent half the morning in the vain search,
ending by the King sending his chamberlain, Lord Fitzhugh, to carry
to Paris a seal already bearing his shield, but lacking the small private
mark that authenticated it as his signet.&nbsp; Fitzhugh would stand
over the lapidary and see this added, and bring it back.&nbsp; Ralf
Percy had meantime been sent to bring a report of the diggers, but he
was long in returning; and when Henry became uneasy, James had volunteered
to go himself, and Henry had consented, not because the air was full
of sleety rain or snow, but because his hands were full of letters needing
to be despatched to all quarters.</p>
<p>The air was so thick that it was not easy to see where were the sullen
group of diggers presided over by the quondam duellists of Thirsk, Kitson
and Trenton, now the most inseparable and impracticable of men; but
James and his companions had ridden about two miles from the market-place,
when Ralf Percy came out of the mist, exclaiming, &lsquo;Is it you,
Sir King?&nbsp; Maybe you can do something with those rascals!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve talked myself blue with cold to make them slope the sides
of their dyke, but the owl Kitson says no Yorkshireman ditcher ever
went but by one fashion, and none ever shall; and when I lifted my riding-rod
at the most insolent of the rogues, what must Trenton do but tell me
the lot were free yeomen, and I&rsquo;d best look out, or they&rsquo;d
roll me in the mire if I meddled with a soul of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t threaten to strike Trenton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; the sullen cur is a gentleman.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas one
of those lubberly men-at-arms!&nbsp; I told them they should hear what
King Harry would say to their mood.&nbsp; I would it were he!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So would I,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Little chance
that they will hearken to a Scot when you have put them in such a mood.&nbsp;
Hold, Ralf, do not go for the King; he has letters for the Emperor mattering
more than this dyke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rode on, and did his best by leaping into the ditch, taking the
spade, and showing the superior security of the angle of inclination
traced by the King, but all in vain; both Trenton and Kitson silently
but obstinately scouted the notion that any king should know more about
ditches than themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See,&rsquo; cried Percy, starting up, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s
other work!&nbsp; The fellows, whence came they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Favoured by the fog and the soft soil of the meadows, a considerable
body of the enemy were stealing on the delvers with the manifest purpose
of cutting them off from the camp.&nbsp; They were all mounted, but
the only horses in the English party were those of James, Percy, Malcolm,
and the half-dozen men of his escort.&nbsp; James, assuming the command
at once, bade these to be all released; they would be sure to find their
way to the camp, and that would bring succour.&nbsp; Meantime he drew
the whole of the men, about thirty in number, into a compact body.&nbsp;
They were, properly, archers, but their bows had been left behind, and
they had only their pikes and bills, which were, however, very formidable
weapons against cavalry as long as they continued in an unbroken rank;
and though the bogs, pools, sunken hedges, and submerged stumps made
it difficult to keep close together as they made their way slowly with
one flank to the river, these obstacles were no small protection against
a charge of horsemen.</p>
<p>For a quarter of a mile these tactics kept them unharmed, but at
length they reached a wide smooth meadow, and the enemy seemed preparing
to charge.&nbsp; James gave orders to close up and stand firm, pikes
outwards.&nbsp; Malcolm&rsquo;s heart beat fast; it was the most real
peril he had yet seen; and yet he was cheered by the King&rsquo;s ringing
voice, &lsquo;Stand firm, ye merry men.&nbsp; They must soon be with
us from the camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice shouted, &lsquo;The Scots! the Scots!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
the Scots!&nbsp; Treachery! we are betrayed.&nbsp; Come, Sir&rsquo;
(to Percy), &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll be on you.&nbsp; Treason!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; it were, you fool, would a Percy turn his back?&rsquo;
cried Ralf, striking at the man; but the panic had seized the whole
body; all were shouting that the false Scots king had brought his countrymen
down on them; they scattered hither and thither, and would have fallen
an easy prey if they had been pursued.&nbsp; But this did not seem to
be the purpose of the enemy, who merely extended themselves so as to
form a hedge around the few who stood, sword in hand, disdaining to
fly.&nbsp; These were, James, somewhat in advance, with his head high,
and a lion look on his brow; Malcolm, white with dismay; Ralf, restless
with fury; Kitson and Trenton, apparently as unmoved as ever; Brewster,
equally steady: and Malcolm&rsquo;s follower, Halbert, in a glow of
hopeful excitement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear, friends,&rsquo; said James, kindly; &lsquo;to
you this can only be matter of ransom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear nothing,&rsquo; sharply answered Ralf.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll stand by you, Sir,&rsquo; said Kitson to Ralf;
&lsquo;but if ever there were foul treason&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw! you ass,&rsquo; were all Percy&rsquo;s thanks; for
at that moment a horseman came forward from among the enemy, a gigantic
form on a tall white horse, altogether a &lsquo;dark gray man,&rsquo;
the open visor revealing an elderly face, hard-featured and grim, and
the shield on his arm so dinted, faded, and battered, as scarce to show
the blue chief and the bleeding crowned heart; but it was no unfamiliar
sight to Malcolm&rsquo;s eyes, and with a slight shudder he bent his
head in answer to the fierce whisper, &lsquo;Old Douglas himself!&rsquo;
with which Hotspur&rsquo;s son certified himself that he had the foe
of his house before him.&nbsp; King James, resting the point of his
sword on his mailed foot, stood erect and gravely expectant; and the
Scot, springing to the ground, advanced with the words, &lsquo;We greet
you well, my liege, and hereby&mdash;&rsquo; he was bending his knee
as he spoke, and removing his gauntlet in preparation for the act of
homage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold, Earl Douglas,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;homage is vain
to a captive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are captive no longer, Sir King,&rsquo; said Earl Archibald.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We have long awaited this occasion, and will at once return to
Scotland with you, with the arms and treasure we have gained here, and
will bear down the craven Albany.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kitson and Trenton looked at one another and grasped their swords,
as though doubting whether they ought not to cut down their king&rsquo;s
prisoner rather than let him be rescued; and meanwhile the cry, &lsquo;Save
King James!&rsquo; broke out on all sides, knights leapt down to tender
their homage, and among the foremost Malcolm knew Sir Patrick Drummond,
crying aloud, &lsquo;My lord, my lord, we have waited long for you.&nbsp;
Be a free king in free Scotland!&nbsp; Trust us, my liege.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust you, my friends!&rsquo; said James, deeply touched;
&lsquo;I trust you with all my heart; but how could you trust me if
I began with a breach of faith to the King of England?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ralf Percy held up his finger and nodded his head to the Yorkshire
squires, who stood open-mouthed, still believing that a Scot must be
false.&nbsp; There was an angry murmur among the Scots, but James gazed
at them undauntedly, as though to look it down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, to King Harry!&rsquo; he said, in his trumpet voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I belong to him, and he has trusted me as never prisoner was
trusted before, nor will I betray that trust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The foul fiend take such niceties,&rsquo; muttered old Douglas;
but, checking himself, he said, &lsquo;Then, Sir, give me your sword,
and we&rsquo;ll have you home as my prisoner, to save this your honour!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;that is mine own, though my
body be yours, and till England put me to ransom you would have but
a useless captive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Sir John Swinton, pressing forward, &lsquo;if
my Lord of Douglas be plain-spoken, bethink you that it is no cause
for casting aside this one hope of freedom that we have sought so long.&nbsp;
If you have the heart to strike for Scotland, this is the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not the time,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;nor will I do
Scotland the wrong of striking for her with a dishonoured hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will we see when we have him at Hermitage Castle,&rsquo;
quoth Douglas to his followers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Sir King, best give
your sword without more grimace.&nbsp; Living or dead you are ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I yield not,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dead you may
take me&mdash;alive, never.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then turning his eyes to the
faces that gazed on him so earnestly in disappointment, in affection,
or in scorn, he spoke: &lsquo;Brave friends, who may perchance love
me the better that I have been a captive half my life and all my reign,
you can believe how sair my heart burns for my bonnie land&rsquo;s sake,
and how little I&rsquo;d reck of my life for her weal.&nbsp; But broken
oaths are ill beginnings.&nbsp; For me, so notably trusted by King Henry,
to break my bonds, would shame both Scots and kings; and it were yet
more paltry to feign to yield to my Lord of Douglas.&nbsp; Rescue or
no rescue, I am England&rsquo;s captive.&nbsp; Gentles, kindly brother
Scots, in one way alone can you free me.&nbsp; Give up this wretched
land of France, whose troubles are but lengthened by your valour.&nbsp;
Let me gang to King Harry and tell him your swords are at his service,
so soon as I am free.&nbsp; Then am I your King indeed; we return together,
staunch hearts and strong hands, and the key shall keep the castle,
and the bracken bush keep the cow, though I lead the life of a dog to
bring it about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His tawny eye flashed with falcon light; and as he stood towering
above all the tall men around, there were few who did not in heart own
him indeed their king.&nbsp; But his picture of royal power accorded
ill with the notions of a Black Douglas, in the most masterful days
of that family; and Earl Archibald, who had come to regard kings as
beings meant to be hectored by Douglases, resentfully exclaimed, &lsquo;Hear
him, comrades; he has avouched himself a Southron at heart.&nbsp; Has
he reckoned how little it would cost to give a thrust to the caitiff
who has lost heart in his prison, and clear the way for Albany, who
is at least a true Scot?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do so, Lord Earl,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;and end a long
captivity.&nbsp; But let these go scatheless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With one voice, Percy, Kitson, Trenton, and Brewster, shouted their
resolve to defend him to the last; and Malcolm, flinging himself on
Patrick Drummond, adjured him to save the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou here, laddie!&rsquo; said Patrick, amazed; and while
several more knights exclaimed, &lsquo;Sir, Sir, we&rsquo;ll see no
hand laid on you!&rsquo; he thrust forward, &lsquo;Take my horse, Sir,
ride on, and I&rsquo;ll see no scathe befall you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;but my feet will serve me
best; we will keep together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Scottish force seemed dividing into two: Douglas and his friends
and retainers, mounted and holding together, as though still undecided
whether to grapple with the King and his half-dozen companions; while
Drummond and about ten more lances were disposed to guard him at all
risks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said James to his English friends; and therewith,
sword in hand, he moved with a steady but swift stride towards the camp,
nor did Douglas attempt pursuit; some of the other horsemen hovered
between, and Patrick Drummond, with a puzzled face, kept near on foot.&nbsp;
So they proceeded till they reached a bank and willow hedge, through
which horses could hardly have pursued them.</p>
<p>On the other side of this, James turned round and said, &lsquo;Thanks,
Sir Knight; I suppose I may not hope that you will become a follower
of the knight adventurer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot fight under the English banner, my liege.&nbsp; Elsewhere
I would fellow you to the death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is no time to show your error,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;and
I therefore counsel you to come no farther.&nbsp; The English will be
pricking forth in search of us: so I will but thank you for your loyal
aid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I entreat you, Sir,&rsquo; cried Patrick, &lsquo;not to believe
that we meant this matter to go as it has done!&nbsp; It had long been
our desire&mdash;of all of us, that is, save my Lord Buchan&rsquo;s
retainers&mdash;to find you and release you; but never did we deem that
Lord Douglas would have dared to conduct matters thus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would be little the better for me did Lord Douglas bring
me back on his own terms,&rsquo; said James, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
no; when I go home, it shall be as a free king, able to do justice to
all alike; and for that I am content to bide my time, and trust to such
as you to back me when it comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And with all my heart, Sir,&rsquo; said Patrick.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would
that you were where I could do so now.&nbsp; Ah! laddie,&rsquo; to Malcolm;
&lsquo;ye&rsquo;re in good hands.&nbsp; My certie, I kenned ye but by
your voice!&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re verily grown into a goodly ship after
all, and ye stood as brave as the rest.&nbsp; My poor father would have
been fain to see this day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm flushed to the ears; somehow Patrick&rsquo;s praise was not
as pleasant to him as he would have expected, and he only faltered,
&lsquo;You know&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ken but what Johnnie Swinton brought me in a letter frae
the Abbot of Coldingham, that my father&mdash;the saints be with him!&mdash;had
been set on and slain by yon accursed Master of Albany&mdash;would that
his thrapple were in my grip!&mdash;that he had sent you southwards
to the King, and that your sister was in St. Abbs.&nbsp; Is it so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm had barely time to make a sign of affirmation, when the King
hurried him on.&nbsp; &lsquo;I grieve to balk you of your family tidings,
but delay will be ill for one or other of us; so fare thee well, Sir
Patrick, till better times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shook the knight&rsquo;s hand as he spoke, cut short his protestations,
and leapt down the bank, saying in a low voice, as he stretched out
his hand and helped Malcolm down after him, &lsquo;He would have known
me again for your guest if we had stood many moments longer; he looked
hard at me as it was; and neither in England nor Scotland may that journey
of mine be blazed abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm was on the whole rather relieved; he could not help feeling
guilty towards Patrick, and unless he could have full time for explanation,
he preferred not falling in with him.</p>
<p>And at the same moment Kitson stepped towards the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,
you are an honest man, and we crave your pardon if we said aught that
seemed in doubt thereof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James laughed, shaking each honest hand, and saying, &lsquo;At least,
good sirs, do not always think Scot and traitor the same word; and thank
you for backing me so gallantly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d wish no better than to back such as you, Sir,&rsquo;
said Kitson heartily; and James then turned to Ralf Percy, and asked
him what he thought of the Douglas face to face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A dour old block!&rsquo; said Ralf.&nbsp; &lsquo;If those
runaways had but stayed within us, the hoary ruffian should have had
his lesson from a Percy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James smiled, for the grim giant was still a good deal more than
a match for the slim, rosy-faced stripling of the house of Percy, who
nevertheless simply deemed his nation and family made him invincible
by either Scot or Frenchman.</p>
<p>The difficulties of their progress, however, entirely occupied them.&nbsp;
Having diverged from the regular track, they had to make their way through
the inundated meadows; sometimes among deep pools, sometimes in quagmires,
or ever hedges; while the water that drenched them was fast freezing,
and darkness came down on them.&nbsp; All stumbled or were bogged at
different times; and Malcolm, shorter and weaker than the rest, and
his lameness becoming more felt than usual, could not help impeding
their progress, and at last was so spent that but for the King&rsquo;s
strong arm he would have spent the night in a bog-hole.</p>
<p>At last the lights were near, the outskirts were gained, the pass-word
given to the watch, and the rough but welcome greeting was heard&mdash;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s
well!&nbsp; More of you come in!&nbsp; How got you off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The rogues got back, then?&rsquo; said Kitson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some score of them,&rsquo; was the answer; &lsquo;but &rsquo;tis
thought most are drowned or stuck by the French.&nbsp; The King is in
a proper rage, as well he may be; but what else could come of a false
Scot in the camp?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have a care, you foul tongue!&rsquo; Percy was the first to
cry; and as torches were now brought out and cast their light on the
well-known faces, the soldiers stood abashed; but James tarried not
for their excuses; his heart was hot at the words which implied that
Henry suspected him, and he strode hastily on to the convent, where
the quadrangle was full of horses and men, and the windows shone with
lights.&nbsp; At the door of the refectory stood a figure whose armour
flashed with light, and his voice sounded through the closed visor&mdash;&lsquo;I
tell you, March, I cannot rest till I knew what his hap has been.&nbsp;
If he have done this thing&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What then?&rsquo; answered James out of the darkness, in a
voice deep with wrath; but Henry started.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You there! you safe!&nbsp; Speak again!&nbsp; Come here that
I may see.&nbsp; Where is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, Sir King,&rsquo; said James, gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now the saints be thanked!&rsquo; cried Henry, joyously.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where be the caitiffs that brought me their false tale?&nbsp;
They shall hang for it at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the less wonder,&rsquo; said James, still coldly, &lsquo;that
they should have thought themselves betrayed, since their king believed
it of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, &rsquo;twas but for a hot moment&mdash;ay, and the bitterest
I ever spent.&nbsp; What could I do when the villains swore that there
were signals and I know not what devices passing?&nbsp; I hoped yet
&rsquo;twas but a plea for their own cowardice, and was mounting to
come and see for you.&nbsp; Come, I should have known you better; I&rsquo;d
rather the whole world deceived me than have distrusted you, Jamie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was that in his tone which ended all resentment, and James&rsquo;s
hand was at once clasped in his, while Henry added, &lsquo;Ho, Provost-marshal!
to the gallows with these knaves!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, Harry,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;let me plead for them.&nbsp;
There was more than ordinary to dismay them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dismay! ay, the more cause they should have stood like honest
men.&nbsp; If a rogue be not to hang for deserting his captain and then
maligning him, soon would knavery be master of all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hear me first, Hal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hear when I return and you are dried.&nbsp; Why,
man, thou art an icicle errant; change thy garments while I go round
the posts, or I shall hear nought for the chattering of thy teeth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I for your cough, if you go, Harry.&nbsp; Surely, &rsquo;tis
Salisbury&rsquo;s night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The more cause that I be on the alert!&nbsp; Could I be everywhere,
mayhap a few winter blasts would not have chilled and frozen all the
manhood out of the host.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke very sharply as he threw him on his horse, and wrapped his
cloak about him&mdash;a poor defence, spite of the ermine lining, against
the frost of the December night for a man whose mother, the fair and
wise Mary de Bohun, had died in early youth from disease of the lungs.</p>
<p>James and the two young partners of his adventure had long been clad
in their gowns of peace, and seated by the fire in the refectory, James
with his harp in his hand, from time to time dreamily calling forth
a few plaintive notes, such as he said always rang in his ears after
hearing a Scottish voice, when they again heard Henry&rsquo;s voice
in hot displeasure with the provost-marshal for having deferred the
execution of the runaways till after the hearing of the story of the
King of Scots.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His commands were not to be transgressed for the king of anything,&rsquo;
and he only reprieved the wretches till morning that their fate might
be more signal.&nbsp; He spoke with the peremptory fierceness that had
of late almost obscured his natural good-humour and kindliness; and
when he entered the refectory and threw himself into a chair by the
fire, he looked wearied out in body and mind, shivered and coughed,
and said with unwonted depression that the sullen fellows would make
a quagmire of their camp after all, since a French reinforcement had
come up, and the vigilance that would be needed would occupy the whole
army.&nbsp; At supper he ate little and spoke less; and when James would
have related his encounter within the Scots, he cut him short, saying,
&lsquo;Let that rest till morning; I am sick of hearing of it!&nbsp;
An air upon thy harp would be more to the purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nor would James have been unwilling to be silent on old Douglas&rsquo;s
conduct if he had not been anxious to plead for the panic-stricken archers,
as well as to extol the conduct of the two youths, and of the Yorkshire
squires; but, as he divined that the young Hotspur would regard praise
from him as an insult, he deferred the subject for his absence, and
launched into a plaintive narrative ballad, to which Henry listened,
leaning back in his chair, often dozing, but without relaxation of the
anxiety that sat on his pale face, and ever and anon wakening within
a heavy sigh, as though his buoyant spirits were giving way under the
weight of care he had brought on himself.</p>
<p>James was just singing of one of the many knightly orphans of romance,
exposed in woods to the nurture of bears, his father slain, his mother
dead of grief&mdash;a ditty he had perhaps chosen for its soporific
powers&mdash;when a gay bugle blast rang through the court of the convent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The French would scarce send to parley thus late,&rsquo; exclaimed
James; but the next moment a joyful clamour arose without, and Henry,
springing to his feet, spoke not, but stood awaiting the tidings with
the colour burning on cheek and brow in suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>An esquire, splashed to the ears, hurried into the room, and falling
on his knees, cried aloud, &lsquo;God save King Harry!&nbsp; News, news,
my lord!&nbsp; The Queen has safely borne you a fair son at Windsor
Castle, five days since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henry did not speak, but took the messenger&rsquo;s hand, wrung it,
and left a costly ring there.&nbsp; Then, taking off his cap, he put
his hands over his face, uttering a few words of fervent thanksgiving
almost within himself, and then turning to the esquire, made further
inquiries after his wife&rsquo;s welfare, took from him the letter that
Archbishop Chicheley had sent, poured out a cup of wine for him, bade
the lords around make him good cheer, but craved license for himself
to retire.</p>
<p>It was so unlike his usual hilarious manner that all looked at one
another in anxiety, and spoke of his unusual susceptibility to fatigue
and care; while the squire, looking at the rich jewel in his hand, declared
within disappointment in his tone, that he would rather have had a mere
flint stone so he had heard King Harry&rsquo;s own cheery voice.</p>
<p>James was not the least anxious of them, but long ere light the next
morning Henry stood at his bedside, saying, &lsquo;I must go round the
posts before mass, Jamie.&nbsp; Will you face the matin frost?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am fitter to face it than thou,&rsquo; said James, rising.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is there need for this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Great need,&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here are these
fresh forces all aglow within their first zeal, and unless they are
worse captains than I suppose them, they will attempt some mischief
ere long&mdash;nor is any time so slack as cock-crow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James was speedily ready, and, within some suppressed sighs, so was
Malcolm, who knew himself in duty bound to attend his master, and was
kept on the alert by seeing Ralf Percy also on foot.&nbsp; But it was
a great relief to him that the young gentleman murmured in no measured
terms against the intolerable activity of their kings.&nbsp; No other
attendants went within them, since Henry was wont to patrol his camp
with as little demonstration as possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would scarcely ask a dog to come out with me this wintry
morn,&rsquo; said he, as he waved back his sleepy chamberlain, Fitzhugh,
and took his brother king&rsquo;s arm; &lsquo;but I could not but crave
a turn with thee, Jamie, ere the hue and cry of rejoicing begins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is poor welcome for your heir,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; said Henry; then, after they had walked
some space in silence, he added, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll mock me, but I
would that this had not befallen at Windsor.&nbsp; I had laid my plans
that it should be otherwise; but ladies are ill to guide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And wherefore should it not have been at fair Windsor?&nbsp;
If I can love it as a prison, sure your son may well love it as a cradle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No dishonour to Windsor,&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;but, sleeping
or waking, this whole night hath this adage rung in my ears&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Harry, born at Monmouth, shall short time live
and all get;<br />
Harry, born at Windsor, shall long time live and lose all.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;A most choice piece of royal poesy and prophecy,&rsquo; laughed
James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, do not charge me with it, thou dainty minstrel.&nbsp;
It was sung to me by mime old Herefordshire nurse, when Windsor seemed
as little within my reach as Meaux, and I never thought of it again
till I looked to have a son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then balk the prophecy,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;Edward born
at Windsor got enough, and lived long enough to boot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too late!&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Archbishop
christened the poor child Harry in the very hour of his birth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; echoed James, rather sarcastically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, &rsquo;tis not solely the rhyme,&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;but
this has been a wakeful night, and not without misgivings whether I
am one who ought to look for joy in his children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is past was not such that you alone should cry <i>mea
culpa</i>,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never thought so till now,&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet
who knows?&nbsp; My father was a winsome young man ere his exile, full
of tenderness to us all, at the rare times he was with us.&nbsp; Who
knows what cares may make of me ere my boy learns to knew me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not hold him aloof, and give him no chance of loving
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trow not!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have him with me in the camp,
and he and my brave men shall be one another&rsquo;s pride.&nbsp; Which
Roman emperor is it that hears the nickname his father&rsquo;s soldiers
gave him as a child?&nbsp; Nay&mdash;Caligula was it?&nbsp; Omens are
against me this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then laughs them to scorn, and be yourself,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bless God for the goodly child, who is born to two kingdoms,
won by his father&rsquo;s and his grandsire&rsquo;s swords.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Henry, depressed by failing health, a sleepless
night, and hungry morning, &lsquo;maybe it were better for him, soul
and body both, did I stand here Duke of Lancaster, and good Edmund of
March yonder were head of realm and army.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never would he be head of this army,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He would be snoring at Shene; that is, if he could sleep for
the trouble the Duke of Lancaster would be giving him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henry laughed at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good King Edmund, he would assuredly
never try to set the world right on its hinges.&nbsp; Honest fellow,
soon he will be as hearty in his congratulations as though he did not
lie under a great wrong.&nbsp; Heigh-ho! such as he may be in the right
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve marvelled of late, whether any priest or
hermit could bring back my old assurance, that all this is my work on
earth, or tell me if it be all one grand error.&nbsp; Men there have
been like C&aelig;sar, Alexander, or Charlemagne, who thought my thoughts
and worked them out; and surely Church and nations cry aloud for purifying.&nbsp;
Jerusalem, and a general council&mdash;I saw them once clear and bright
before me; but now a mist seems to rise up from Richard&rsquo;s blood,
and hide them from me; and there comes from it my father&rsquo;s voice
when he asked on his deathbed what right I had to the crown.&nbsp; What
would it be if I had to leave this work half done?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the sight of a young knight stealing into the
camp, after a furtive expedition to Paris.&nbsp; It was enough to rouse
him from his despondent state; and the severity of his wrath was in
full proportion to the offence.&nbsp; Nor did he again utter his misgivings,
but was full of his usual alacrity and life, as though daylight had
restored his buoyancy.</p>
<p>James, on the way back to the thanksgiving mass, interceded for last
night&rsquo;s offenders, as an act of grace suitable to the occasion;
but Henry was inexorable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had they stood to die like Englishmen, they had not lied like
dogs! &lsquo;he said; &lsquo;and as dogs they shall hang!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In fact, in the critical state of his army, he knew that the only
safety lay in the promptest and sternest justice; and therefore the
three foremost in accusing King James of treachery were hung long before
noon.</p>
<p>However, he called for the two Yorkshiremen, and thus addressed them:
&lsquo;Well done, my masters!&nbsp; Thanks for showing Scots and Frenchmen
what stuff Englishmen are made of!&nbsp; I keep my word, good fellows.&nbsp;
Kneel down, and I&rsquo;ll dub each a knight.&nbsp; How now! what are
you blundering and whispering for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So please you, Sir,&rsquo; said Kitson, &lsquo;this is no
matter to win one&rsquo;s spurs for&mdash;mere standing still without
a blow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would all had that same gift of standing still,&rsquo; returned
Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is it sticks in your gizzard, friend?&nbsp;
If &rsquo;tis the fees, I take them on myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; hoarsely cried both.</p>
<p>And Kitson explained: &lsquo;Sir, you said you&rsquo;d knight the
one of us that was foremost.&nbsp; Now, the two being dubbed, we shall
be but where we were before as to Mistress Agnes of Mineshull, unless
of your good-will you would be pleased to let us fight out the wager
of the heriard in all peace and amity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henry burst out laughing, with all his old merriment, as he said,
&lsquo;For no Mistress Agnes living can I have honest men&rsquo;s lives
wasted, specially of such as have that gift of standing still.&nbsp;
If she does not knew her own mind, one of you must get himself killed
by the Frenchmen, not by one another.&nbsp; So kneel down, and we&rsquo;ll
make your knighthood&rsquo;s feast fall in with that of my son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus Sir Christopher Kitson and Sir William Trenton rose up knights;
and bore their honours with a certain bluntness that made them butts,
even while they were the heroes of the day; and Henry, who had resumed
his gay temper, made much diversion out of their mingled shrewdness
and gruffness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So,&rsquo; muttered Malcolm to Ralf Percy, &lsquo;we are passed
over in the self-same matter for which these fellows are knighted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tush!&rsquo; answered Percy; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d scorn to be
confounded with a couple of clowns like them!&nbsp; Moreover,&rsquo;
he added, with better reason, &lsquo;their valour was more exercised
than ours, inasmuch as they thought there was treachery, and we did
not.&nbsp; No, no; when my spurs are won, it shall be for some prowess,
better than standing stock-still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm held his tongue, unwilling that Percy should see that he
did feel this an achievement; but he was vexed at the lack of reward,
fancying that knighthood would be no small step in the favour of that
imaginary Esclairmonde whom he had made for himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Light of the world&rsquo; he loved to call her still, but
it was in the commonplace romance of his time, the mere light of beauty
and grace illuminating the world of chivalry.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII: THE CAPTURE</h2>
<p>The seven months&rsquo; siege ended at last, but it was not until
the brightness of May was on the fields outside, and the deadly blight
of famine on all within, that a haggard, wasted-looking deputation came
down from the upper city to treat with the King.</p>
<p>Henry was never severe with the inhabitants of French cities, and
exacted no harsh terms, save that he insisted that Vaurus, the robber
captain, and his two chief lieutenants, should be given up to him to
suffer condign punishment.&nbsp; The warriors who had shut themselves
up to hold out the place by honourable warfare for the Dauphin must
be put to ransom as prisoners of war; but the burghers were to be unmolested,
on condition of their swearing allegiance to Henry as regent for, and
heir of, Charles VI.</p>
<p>To this the deputies consented, and the next day was fixed for the
surrender.&nbsp; The difficulty was, as Henry had found at Harfleur,
Rouen, and many other places, to enforce forbearance on his soldiery,
who regarded plunder as their lawful prey, the enemy as their natural
game, and the trouble a city had given them as a cause for unmercifulness.&nbsp;
The more time changed his army from the feudal gathering of English
country gentlemen and yeomen to mercenary bands of men-at-arms, the
mere greedy, rapacious, and insubordinate became their temper.&nbsp;
Well knowing the greatness of the peril, and that the very best of his
captains had scarcely the will, if they had the power, to restrain the
license that soon became barbarity unimaginable, he spoke sadly overnight
of his dread of the day of surrender, when it might prove impossible
to prevent deeds that would be not merely a blot on his scutcheon, but
a shame to human nature; looking back to the exultation with which he
had entered Harfleur as a mere effect of boyish ignorance and thoughtlessness.</p>
<p>Having taken all possible precautions, he stood in his full armour,
with the fox&rsquo;s brush in his helmet, under the great elm in the
market-place, received the keys, accepted the sword of the captain commissioned
by Charles with royal courtesy, gave his hand to be kissed by the mayor;
and then, with grave inexorable air, like a statue of steel, watched
as the freebooter Vaurus and his two chief companions were led down
with their hands tied, halters round their necks, and priests at their
sides, preparing them to be hung on that very tree.&nbsp; They were
proud hard men, and uttered no entreaty for grace.&nbsp; They had hung
too many travellers upon these same branches not to expect their own
turn, and they were no cravens to abase themselves.</p>
<p>That act of justice ended, Henry mounted his warhorse and rode in
at the gates.&nbsp; His wont was to go straight to the principal church,
and there attend a solemn mass of thanksgiving; but experience had taught
him that his devotions were the very opportunity of his men&rsquo;s
rapine: he had therefore arranged that as soon as he should have arrived
in the choir of the cathedral, James should take his place, and he slip
out by a side door, so as to return to the scene of action.</p>
<p>In full procession he and his suite reached the chief door, and there
dismounted in an immense crowd, which thronged in at the doors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Glenuskie,&rsquo; said Ralf Percy, as the two youths
were pushed chose together in the press; &lsquo;if you have a fancy
for being smothered in the minster, I have none.&nbsp; We shall never
be missed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be sport to walk round and see how these
hardy rogues contrived to hold out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm willingly turned aside with him, and looked down the sloping
street, which was swarming with comers and goers.&nbsp; The whole place
was in an inflammable state.&nbsp; Soldiers were demanding quarters,
which the citizens unwillingly gave.&nbsp; A refusal or expostulation
against a rough entry led to violence; and ever as the two youths walked
farther from the cathedral, there was more of excitement, more rude
oaths of soldiers, more shrieking of women, often crying out even before
any harm was done to them or their houses.</p>
<p>At last, before a tall overhanging house, there was an immense press,
and a frightful din of shouts and imprecations, filling both the new-comers
with infectious eagerness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How now? how now?&rsquo; called Percy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep the
peace, good fellows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; cried a number of voices, passionately, &lsquo;the
French villains have barred their door.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lot of
cowardly Armagnacs hid there with their gold, trying to balk honest
men of their ransom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such was the cry resounding on all sides.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have at them!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the rogue at the windows.&nbsp; Out on the fellows!&nbsp;
Burn down the door!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Vaurus himself and all his gold.&nbsp;
Treason! treason!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clamour was convincing to the spirit, if not to the senses.&nbsp;
The two lads believed in the concealed Armagnacs, or perhaps more truly
were carried away by the vehemence around them; and with something of
the spirit of the chase, threw themselves headlong into the affair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Open! open!&rsquo; shouted Ralf.&nbsp; &lsquo;Open, in the
name of King Henry!&rsquo;</p>
<p>An old man&rsquo;s face peeped through a little wicket in the door,
and at sight of the two youths, evidently of high rank, said in a trembling
voice, &lsquo;Alas! alas!&nbsp; Sir, bid these cruel men go away.&nbsp;
I have nothing here&mdash;no one&mdash;only my sick daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You hear,&rsquo; said Malcolm, turning round; &lsquo;only
his sick daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sick daughter!&mdash;old liar!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s an honest
tinker makes oath he has hoards of gold laid up for Vaurus, and ten
Armagnacs hidden in his house.&nbsp; Have at him!&nbsp; Bring fire!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Blows hailed thick on the door; a flaming torch was handed over the
heads of the throng; horrible growls and roars pervaded them.&nbsp;
Malcolm and Ralf, furious at the cheat, stood among the foremost, making
so much noise themselves between thundering and reviling, and calling
out, &lsquo;Where are the Armagnacs?&nbsp; Down with the traitors!&rsquo;
that they were not aware of a sudden hush behind them, till a buffet
from a heavy hand fell on Malcolm&rsquo;s shoulder, and a mighty voice
cried &lsquo;Shame! shame!&nbsp; What, you too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are traitors hid here, Sir,&rsquo; said Percy, in angry
self-justification.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what an if there are?&nbsp; Back, every one of you! rogues
that you be!&mdash;Here, Fitzhugh, see those villains back to the camp.&nbsp;
Let their arms be given up to the Provost-marshal.&mdash;Kites and crows
as you are!&nbsp; Away, out with you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henry pointed to the broken door, and the cowed and abashed soldiers
slunk away from the terrible light of his eyes.&nbsp; No man could stand
before the face of the King.</p>
<p>There was a stillness.&nbsp; He stood leaning on his sword, his chest
heaving with his panting breaths.&nbsp; He was naturally as fleet as
the swift-footed Achilles, but the winter had told upon him, and the
haste with which he had rushed to the rescue left him breathless and
speechless, while he seemed as it were to nail the two lads to the spot
by his steady gaze of mingled distress and displeasure.</p>
<p>Neither could brook his eye: Percy hung his head like a boy in a
scrape; Malcolm quailed with terror, but at the same time felt a keen
sense of injury in being thus treated as a plunderer, and the blow under
which his shoulder ached seemed an indignity to his royal blood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Boys,&rsquo; said Henry, still low and breathlesly, but all
the more impressively, &lsquo;what is to become of honour and mercy
if such as you must needs become ravening wolves at scent of booty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not booty, Sir; they said traitors were hid here,&rsquo;
said Percy, sulkily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tush! the old story!&nbsp; Ever the plea for rapine and bloodthirstiness.&nbsp;
After the warnings of last night you should have known better; but you
are all alike in frenzy for a sack.&nbsp; You have both put off your
knighthood till you have learnt not to become a shame thereto.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take not knighthood at your hands, Sir,&rsquo; burst out
Malcolm, goaded with hot resentment, but startled the next moment at
the sound of his own words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cry you mercy,&rsquo; said King Henry, in a cold, short
tone.</p>
<p>Malcolm turned on his heel and walked away, without waiting to see
how the poor old man in the house threw himself at the King&rsquo;s
feet with a piteous history of his sick daughter and her starving children,
nor how Ralf hurried off headlong to the lower town to send them immediate
relief in bread, wine, and doctors.&nbsp; The gay, good-natured, thoughtless
lad no mere harboured malice for the chastisement than if his tutor
had caught him idling; but things went deeper with Malcolm.&nbsp; True,
he had undergone many a brutal jest and cruel practical joke from his
cousins; but that was all in the family, not like a blow from an alien
king, and one not apologized for, but followed up by a rebuke that seemed
to him unjust, lowering him in his own eyes and those of Esclairmonde,
and making him ready to gnaw himself with moody vexation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You here, Malcolm!&rsquo; said King James, entering his quarters;
&lsquo;did you miss me in the throng?&nbsp; I have not seen you all
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been insulted, Sir,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
pray your license to depart and carry my sword to my kinsmen in the
French camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How now!&nbsp; Is it the way to treat an insult to run away
from it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not when the world judges men to be on equal terms, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; Who has done you wrong, you silly loon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;King Henry, Sir; he struck me with his fist, and rated me
like his hound; and I will not eat another morsel of his bread unless
he would answer it to me in single combat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little enough bread you&rsquo;d eat after that same answer!&rsquo;
ejaculated James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I understand now.&nbsp; You
were with young Hotspur and the rest that set on the poor townsmen,
and Harry made small distinction of persons!&nbsp; Nay, Malcolm, it
was ill in you, that talked of so loathing spulzie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted no spulzie.&nbsp; There were Armagnacs hid in the
house, and the King would not hear us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He knew that story too well.&nbsp; Were you asleep or idling
last night, when he warned all, on no plea whatever, to break into a
house, but, if the old tale of treachery came up, to set a guard, and
call one of the captains?&nbsp; Did you hear him&mdash;eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can take chiding from you, Sir, but neither words nor blows
from any other king in Christendom, still less when he threatens me
that I have deferred my knighthood!&nbsp; As if I would have it from
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From me you will not have it until he have pardoned Ralf Percy,&rsquo;
said James, dryly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Malcolm, I had not thought you such
a fule body!&nbsp; Under a captain&rsquo;s banner, what can be done
but submit to his rule?&nbsp; I should do so myself, were Salisbury
or March in command.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, Sir,&rsquo; said Malcolm, much hurt that the King did
not take his part, &lsquo;I shall carry my service elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So,&rsquo; said James, much vexed, &lsquo;this is the meek
lad that wanted to hide in a convent from an ill world, flying off from
his king and kinsman that he may break down honest men&rsquo;s doors
at his will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I may be free from insult, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think John of Buchan like to cosset you!&nbsp; You found
the Black Douglas so courtly to me the other day as to expect him to
be tender to this nicety of yours!&nbsp; Malcolm, as your prince and
guardian, I forbid this folly, and command you to lay aside this fit
of malice and do your devoir.&nbsp; What! sobbing, silly lad&mdash;where&rsquo;s
your manhood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, Sir, what will they think of me&mdash;the Lady Esclairmonde
and all&mdash;if they hear I have sat down tamely with a blow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will never think about you at all but as a sullen malapert
ne&rsquo;er-do-weel, if you go off to that camp of <i>routiers</i>,
trying to prop a bad cause because you cannot take correction, nor observe
discipline.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A sudden suspicion came over Malcolm that the King would not thus
make light of the offence, if it had really been the inexpiable insult
he had supposed it, and the thought was an absolute relief; for in effect
the parting from James, and joining the party opposed to Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
friends, would have been so tremendous a step, that he could hardly
have contemplated it in his sober senses, and he murmured, &lsquo;My
honour, Sir,&rsquo; in a tone that James understood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, for your honour&mdash;you need not fear for that!&nbsp;
Any knight in the army could have done as much without prejudice to
your honour.&nbsp; Why, you silly loon, d&rsquo;ye think I would not
have been as angered as yourself, if your honour had been injured?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm&rsquo;s heart felt easier, but he still growled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,
Sir, if you assure me that I can do so without detriment to my honour,
I will not quit you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It might have been more graciously spoken,
my good cousin, but I am beholden to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm, ashamed and vexed at the sarcastic tone, held his tongue
for a little while, but presently exclaimed, &lsquo;Will the Bishop
of Th&eacute;rouenne hear of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>James laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Belike not; or, if he should, it would
only seem to him the reasonable training of a young squire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King did not say what crossed his own mind, that the Bishop of
Th&eacute;rouenne was more likely to think Henry over-strict in discipline,
and absurdly rigorous.</p>
<p>The prelate, Charles de Luxemburg, brother to the Count de St. Pol,
had made several visits to the English camp.&nbsp; He was one of these
princely younger sons, who, like Beaufort at home, took ecclesiastical
preferments as their natural provision, and as a footing whence they
might become statesmen.&nbsp; He was a great admirer of Henry&rsquo;s
genius, and, as the chief French prelate who was heartily on the English
side, enjoyed a much greater prominence than he could have done at either
the French or Burgundian Court.&nbsp; He and his brother of St. Pol
were Esclairmonde&rsquo;s nearest kinsmen&mdash;&lsquo;oncles &agrave;
la mode de Bretagne,&rsquo; as they call the relationship which is here
sometimes termed Welsh uncle, or first cousins once removed&mdash;and
from him James had obtained much more complete information about Esclairmonde
than he could ever get from the flighty Duchess.</p>
<p>Her mother, a beautiful Walloon, had been heiress to wide domains
in Hainault, her father to great estates in Flanders, all which were
at present managed by the politic Bishop.&nbsp; Like most of the statesman-secular-clergy,
the Bishop hated nothing so much as the monastic orders, and had made
no small haste to remove his fair niece from the convent at Dijon, where
she had been educated, lest the Cistercians should become possessed
of her lands.&nbsp; He had one scheme for her marriage; but his brother,
the Count, had wished to give her to his own second son, who was almost
an infant; and the Duke of Burgundy had designs on her for his half-brother
Bo&euml;mond; and among these various disputants, Esclairmonde had never
failed to find support against whichever proposal was forced upon her,
until the coalition between the Dukes of Burgundy and Brabant becoming
too strong, she had availed herself of Countess Jaqueline&rsquo;s discontent
to evade them both.</p>
<p>The family had, of course, been much angered, and had fully expected
that her estates would go to some great English abbey, or to some English
lord whose haughty reserve and insularity would be insupportable.&nbsp;
It was therefore a relief to Monseigneur de Th&eacute;rouenne to hear
James&rsquo;s designs; and when the King further added, that he would
be willing to let the claims on the Hainault part of her estates be
purchased by the Count de St. Pol, and those in Flanders by the Duke
of Burgundy, the Bishop was delighted, and declared that, rather than
such a negotiation should fail, he would himself advance the sum to
his brother; but that the Duke of Burgundy&rsquo;s consent was more
doubtful, only could they not do without it?</p>
<p>And he honoured Malcolm with a few words of passing notice from time
to time, as if he almost regarded him as a relation.&nbsp; No doubt
it would have been absurd to fly from such chances as these to Patrick
Drummond and the opposite camp; and yet there were times when Malcolm
felt as if he should get rid of a load on his heart if he were to break
with all his present life, hurry to Patrick, confess the whole to him,
and then&mdash;hide his head in some hermitage, leaving his pledge unforfeited!</p>
<p>That, however, could not be.&nbsp; He was bound to the King, and
might not desert him, and it was not unpleasant to brood over the sacrifice
of his own displeasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See,&rsquo; said Henry, in the evening, as he came into the
refectory and walked up to James, &lsquo;I have found my signet.&nbsp;
It was left in the finger of my Spanish glove, which I had not worn
since the beginning of winter.&nbsp; Thanks to all who took vain pains
to look for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Malcolm did not respond with his pleased look to the thanks.&nbsp;
He was not in charity with Henry, and crept out of hearing of him, while
James was saying, &lsquo;You had best destroy one or the other, or they
will make mischief.&nbsp; Here, I&rsquo;ll crush it with the pommel
of my sword.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Henry, laughing, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d like to
shew off one of your sledge-hammer blows&mdash;Sir Bras de Fer!&nbsp;
But, Master Scot, you shall not smash the English shield so easily.&nbsp;
This one hangs too loose to be safe; I shall keep it to serve me when
we have fattened up at Paris, after the leanness of our siege.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hal,&rsquo; said James, seeing his gay temper restored, &lsquo;you
have grievously hurt that springald of mine.&nbsp; His northern blood
cannot away with the taste he got of your fist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty well for your godly young monk, to expect to rob unchecked!&rsquo;
laughed Henry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will do well at last,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Manhood
has come on him with a rush, and borne him off his feet; nor would I
have him over-tame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There spake the Scot!&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;By my
faith, Jamie, we should have had you the worst robber of all had we
not caught you young!&nbsp; Well, what am I do for this sprig of royalty?&nbsp;
Say I struck unawares?&nbsp; Nay, had I known him, I&rsquo;d have struck
with as much of a will as his slight bones would bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An you love me, Hal, do something to cool his ill blood, and
remove the sense of shame that sinks a lad in his own eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Methought,&rsquo; said Henry, &lsquo;there was more shame
in the deed than in the buffet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless the good-natured King took an occasion of saying: &lsquo;My
Lord of Glenuskie, I smote without knowing you.&nbsp; It was no place
for a prince&mdash;nay, for any honest man; otherwise no hand should
have been laid on my guest or my brother&rsquo;s near kinsman.&nbsp;
And whereas I hear that both you and my fiery hot Percy verily credited
the cry that prisoners were hid in that house, let me warn you that
never was place yielded on composition but some villain got up the shout,
and hundreds of fools followed it, till they learnt villainy in their
turn.&nbsp; Therefore I ever chastise transgression of my command to
touch neither dwelling nor inhabitant.&nbsp; You have both learnt your
lesson, and the lion rampant and he of the straight tail will both be
reined up better another time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm had no choice but to bend his head, mutter something, and
let the King grasp his hand, though to him the apology seemed none at
all, but rather to increase the offence, since the blame was by no means
taken back again, while the condescension was such as could not be rejected,
and thus speciously took away his excuse for brooding over his wrath.&nbsp;
His hand lay so unwillingly in that strong hearty clasp that the King
dropped it, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and muttered to himself,
&lsquo;Sullen young dog!&nbsp; No Scot can let bygones be bygones!&rsquo;
and then he turned away and cast the trifle from his memory.</p>
<p>James was amazed not to see the moody face clear up, and asked of
Malcolm whether he were not gratified with this ample satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trow I must be, Sir,&rsquo; said Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell thee, boy,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;not one king&mdash;nay,
not one man&mdash;in a thousand would have offered thee the frank amends
King Harry hath done this day: nay, I doubt whether even he could so
have done, were it not that the hope of his wife&rsquo;s coming hath
made him overflow with joy and charity to all the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm did not make much reply, and James regarded him with some
disappointment.&nbsp; The youth was certainly warmly attached to him,
but these tokens of superiority to the faults of his time and country
which had caused the King to seek him for a companion seemed to have
vanished with his feebleness and timidity.&nbsp; The manhood that had
been awakened was not the chivalrous, generous, and gentle strength
of Henry and his brothers, but the punctilious pride and sullenness,
and almost something of the license, of the Scot.&nbsp; The camp had
not proved the school of chivalry that James, in his inexperience, had
imagined it must be under Henry, and the tedium and wretchedness of
the siege had greatly added to its necessary evils by promoting a reckless
temper and willingness to snatch at any enjoyment without heed to consequences.&nbsp;
Close attendance on the kings had indeed prevented either Malcolm or
Percy from even having the temptation of running into any such lengths
as those gentry who had plundered the shrine of St. Fiacre at Breuil,
or were continually galloping off for an interval of dissipation at
Paris; but they were both on the outlook for any snatch of stolen diversion,
for in ceasing from monastic habits Malcolm seemed to have laid aside
the scruples of a religious or conscientious youth, and specially avoided
Dr. Bennet, the King&rsquo;s almoner.</p>
<p>James feared he had been mistaken, and looked to the influence of
Esclairmonde to repair the evil, if perchance she should follow the
Queen to France.&nbsp; And this it was almost certain she must do, since
she was entirely dependent upon the Countess of Hainault, and could
not obtain admission to a nunnery without recovering a portion of her
estates.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX: THE DANCE OF DEATH</h2>
<p>The Queen was coming!&nbsp; No sooner had the first note of surrender
been sounded from the towers of Meaux, than Henry had sent intelligence
to England that the way was open for the safe arrival of his much-loved
wife; and at length, on a sunny day in May, tidings were received that
she had landed in France, under the escort of the Duke of Bedford.</p>
<p>Vincennes, in the midst of its noble forest, was the place fixed
for the meeting of the royal pair; and never did a happier or more brilliant
cavalcade traverse those woodlands than that with which Henry rode to
the appointed spot.</p>
<p>All the winter, the King had heeded appearances as little as of old
when roughing it with Hotspur in Wales; but now his dress was of the
most royal.&nbsp; On his head was a small green velvet cap, encircled
by a crown in embroidery; his robe was of scarlet silk, and over it
was thrown a mantle of dark green samite, thickly powdered with tiny
embroidered white antelopes; the Garter was on his knee, the George
on his neck.&nbsp; It was a kingly garb, and well became the tall slight
person and fair noble features.&nbsp; During these tedious months he
had looked wan, haggard, and careworn; but the lines of anxiety were
all effaced, his lustrous blue eyes shone and danced like Easter suns,
his complexion rivalled the fresh delicate tints of the blossoms in
the orchards; and when, with a shyness for which he laughed at himself,
he halted to brush away any trace of dust that might offend the eye
of his &lsquo;dainty Kate,&rsquo; and gaily asked his brother king if
he were sufficiently pranked out for a lady&rsquo;s bower, James, thinking
he had never seen him so handsome, replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like a young bridegroom&mdash;nay, more like a young suitor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re jealous, Jamie&mdash;afraid of being outshone.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis is your own fault, man; none can ever tell whether you be
in festal trim or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For King James&rsquo;s taste was for sober, well-blending hues; and
as he never lapsed into Henry&rsquo;s carelessness, his state apparel
was not very apparently dissimilar from his ordinary dress, being generally
of dark rich crimson, blue, or russet, with the St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross
in white silk on his breast, or else the ruddy lion, but never conspicuously;
and the sombre hues always seemed particularly well to suit his auburn
colouring.</p>
<p>Malcolm, in scarlet and gold, was a far gayer figure, and quite conscious
of the change in his own appearance&mdash;how much taller, ruddier,
and browner he had become; how much better he held himself both in riding
and walking; and how much awkwardness and embarrassment he had lost.&nbsp;
No wonder Esclairmonde had despised the sickly, timid, monkish school-boy;
and if she had then shown him any sort of grace or preference, what
would she think of the princely young squire he could new show her,
who had seen service, had proved his valour, and was only not a knight
because of King Henry&rsquo;s unkindness and King James&rsquo;s punctilio?&mdash;at
any rate, no child to be brow-beaten and silenced with folly about cloistral
dedication, but a youth who had taken his place in the world, and could
allege that his inspiration had come through her bright eyes.</p>
<p>Would she be there?&nbsp; That was the chief anxiety: for it was
not certain that either she or her mistress would risk themselves on
the Continent; and Catherine had given no intimation as to who would
be in her suite&mdash;so that, as Henry had merrily observed, he was
the only one in the whole party who was not in suspense, except indeed
Salisbury, who had sent his commands to his little daughter to come
out with the Queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is come!&rsquo; cried Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Beforehand with
us, after all;&rsquo; and he spurred his horse on as he saw the banner
raised, and the escort around the gate; and in a few seconds more he
and his companions had hurried through the court, where the ladies had
scarcely dismounted, and hastened into the hall, breaking into the seneschal&rsquo;s
solemn reception of the Queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Kate, my fairest!&nbsp; Mine eyes have been hungry for
a sight of thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Catherine, in her horned head-gear and flutter of spangled veil,
was almost swallowed up in his hearty embrace; and the fervency of his
great love so far warmed her, that she clung to him, and tenderly said,
&lsquo;My lord, it is long since I saw you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou wert before me!&nbsp; Ah! forgive thy tardy knight,&rsquo;
he continued, gazing at her really enhanced beauty as if he had eyes
for no one else, even while with lip and hand, kiss, grasp, and word,
he greeted her companions, of whom Jaqueline of Hainault and John of
Bedford were the most prominent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the babe! where is he?&rsquo; then cried he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let
me have him to hold up to my brave fellows in the court!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Prince of Wales?&rsquo; said Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
never spake of my bringing him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I spake not, it was because I doubted not for a moment
that you would keep him with you.&nbsp; Nay, verily it is not in sooth
that you left him.&nbsp; You are merely sporting with use.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truly, Sir,&rsquo; said Catherine, &lsquo;I never guessed
that you would clog yourself with a babe in the cradle, and I deemed
him more safely nursed at Windsor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be for his safety!&nbsp; Yet a soldier&rsquo;s boy should
thrive among soldiers,&rsquo; said the King, evidently much disappointed,
and proceeding to eager inquiries as to the appearance and progress
of his child; to which the Queen replied with a certain languor, as
though she had no very intimate personal knowledge of her little son.</p>
<p>Other eyes were meanwhile eagerly scanning the bright confusion of
veils and wimples; and Malcolm had just made out the tall head and dark
locks under a long almost shrouding white veil far away in the background
behind the Countess of Hainault, when the Duke of Bedford came up with
a frown of consternation on his always anxious face, and drawing King
James into a window, said, &lsquo;What have you been doing to him?&rsquo;&mdash;to
which James, without hearing the question, replied, &lsquo;Where is
<i>she</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joan?&nbsp; At home.&nbsp; It was the Queen&rsquo;s will.&nbsp;
Of that another time.&nbsp; But what means this?&rsquo; and he signed
towards his brother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never saw I man so changed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you seen him at Christmas you might have said so,&rsquo;
replied James; &lsquo;but now I see naught amiss; I had been thinking
I had never seen him so fair and comely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you, James,&rsquo; said Bedford, contracting his brows
till they almost met ever his arched nose, &lsquo;I tell you, his look
brings back to me my mother&rsquo;s, the last time she greeted my father!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To your fantasy, not your memory, John!&nbsp; You were a mere
babe at her death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of five years,&rsquo; said Bedford.&nbsp; &lsquo;That face&mdash;that
cough&mdash;have brought all back&mdash;ay, the yearning look when my
father was absent, and the pure rosy fairness that Harry and Tom cited
so fiercely against one who would have told them how sick to death she
was.&nbsp; I mind me too, that when our grandame of Hereford made us
motherless children over to our grandsire of Lancaster, it was with
a warning that Harry had the tender lungs of the Bohuns, and needed
care.&nbsp; One deadly sickness he had at Kenilworth, when my father
was ridden for post-haste.&nbsp; My mind misgave me throughout this
weary siege; but his service held me fast at home, and I trusted that
you would watch over him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man like him is ill to guide,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;but
he is more himself now than he has been for months, and a few weeks&rsquo;
quiet with his wife will restore him.&nbsp; But what is this?&rsquo;
he proceeded in his turn; &lsquo;why is the Lady Joan not here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I tell?&nbsp; It was no fault of mine.&nbsp; I even
got a prim warning that it became me not to meddle about her ladies,
and I doubted what slanders you might hear if I were seen asking your
Nightingale for a token.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you none!&nbsp; Good John, I know you have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John smiled his ironical smile, produced from the pouch at his girdle
a small packet bound with rose-coloured silk, and said: &lsquo;The Nightingale
hath a plume, you see, and saith, moreover, that her knight hath done
his devoir passably, but that she yet looks to see him send some captive
giant to her feet.&nbsp; So, Sir Knight, I hope your poor dwarf hath
acquitted him well in your chivalrous jargon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James smiled and coloured with pleasure; the fantastic message was
not devoid of reality in the days when young imaginative spirits tried
to hide the prose of war and policy in a bright mist of romantic fancy;
nor was he ashamed to bend his manly head in reverence to, and even
press to his lips, his lady&rsquo;s first love-letter, in the very sight
of the satirical though sympathizing Bedford, of whom he eagerly asked
of the fair Joan&rsquo;s health and welfare, and whether she were flouted
by Queen Catherine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more than is the meed of her beauty,&rsquo; said Bedford.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sister Kate likes not worship at any shrine save one.&nbsp; Look
at our suite: our knights&mdash;yea, our very grooms are picked for
their comeliness; to wit that great feather-pated oaf of a Welshman,
Owen Tudor there; while dames and demoiselles, tire-women and all, are
as near akin as may be to Sir Gawain&rsquo;s loathly lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at least the fair Luxemburg.&nbsp; Did not I see her stately
mien?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is none of the Queen&rsquo;s, and moreover she stands
aloof, so that the women forgive her gifts!&nbsp; There is that cough
of Harry&rsquo;s again!&nbsp; He is the shadow of the man he was; I
would I knew if this were the step-dame&rsquo;s doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, John, when you talk to me of Harry&rsquo;s cough, and
of night-watches and flooded camps, I hearken; but when your wits run
wool-gathering after that poor woman, making waxen images stuck full&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are in the right on&rsquo;t, James,&rsquo; said Henry,
who had come up to them while he was speaking.&nbsp; &lsquo;John will
never get sorceries out of his head.&nbsp; I have thought it over, and
will not be led into oppressing my father&rsquo;s widow any more.&nbsp;
I cannot spend this Pentecost cheerily till I know she is set free and
restored to her manors; and I shall write to Humfrey and the Council
to that effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as John shrugged his shoulders, Henry gaily added: &lsquo;Thou
seest what comes of a winter spent with this unbeliever Jamie; and truly,
I found the thought of unright to my father&rsquo;s widow was a worse
pin in my heart than ever she is like to thrust there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus then it was, that in the overflowing joy and good-will of his
heart, and mayhap with the presentiment which rendered him willing to
be at peace with all his kindred, Henry forgave and released his step-mother,
Joan of Navarre, whom common rumour termed the Witch Queen, and whom
he had certainly little reason to love, whether it were true or not
that she had attempted to weave spells against him.&nbsp; In fact, there
were few of the new-comers from England who did not, like Bedford, impute
the transparency of Henry&rsquo;s hands, and the hollowness of his brightly-tinted
cheek, to some form of sorcery.</p>
<p>Meantime, Esclairmonde de Luxemburg, more beautiful than ever under
a still simpler dress, had greeted Malcolm with her wonted kindness;
adding, with a smile, that he was so much grown and embrowned that she
should not have known him but for the sweet Scottish voice which he,
like his king, possessed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do me too much grace in commending aught that is mine,
madame,&rsquo; said Malcolm, with an attempt at the assurance he believed
himself to have acquired; but he could only finish by faltering and
blushing.&nbsp; There was a power of repression about Esclairmonde that
annihilated all his designs, and drove him back into his bashful self
whenever he came into contact with her, and felt how unlike the grave
serene loftiness of her presence was to the mere queen of romance, that
in her absence her shadow had become.</p>
<p>Alice Montagu, returning to her side, relieved while disconcerting
him.&nbsp; Sweet little Alice had been in a continual flutter ever since
commands had come from Meaux that she was to come out to meet the father
whom she had not seen since what seemed like half her childish lifetime,
and the betrothed whom she had never seen at all; and Lady Westmoreland
had added to her awe by the lengthened admonition with which she took
leave of her.&nbsp; And on this day, when Esclairmonde herself had arrayed
the fair child in the daintiest of rose-pink boddices edged with swan&rsquo;s-down,
the whitest of kirtles, and softest of rosy veils, the flush of anxiety
on the pale little face made it so fair to look upon, that as the maiden
wistfully asked, &lsquo;Think you he will flout me?&rsquo; it was impossible
not to laugh at the very notion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! but I would be glad
if he did, for then I might bide with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When, in the general greeting, Alice had been sought out by a tall,
dark-browed, grizzled warrior, Esclairmonde had, cruelly, as the maiden
thought, kept her station behind the Countess, and never stirred for
all those wistful backward glances, but left her alone to drop on her
knee to seek the blessing of the mighty old soldier.</p>
<p>And now she was holding his great hand, almost as tough as his gauntlets,
and leading him up to her friend, while he louted low, and spoke with
a grand fatherly courtesy:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair demoiselle, this silly wench of mine tells me that you
have been good friend to her, and I thank you for the same with all
mine heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silly&rsquo; was a fond term of love then, and had all the
affection of a proud father in it, as the Earl of Salisbury patted the
small soft fingers in his grasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truly, my lord,&rsquo; responded Esclairmonde, &lsquo;the
Lady Alice hath been my sweetest companion, friend, and sister, for
these many months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, child, art worthy to be called friend by such a lady
as this?&nbsp; If so, I shall deem my little Alice grown a woman indeed,
as it is time she were&mdash;Diccon Nevil is bent on the wedding before
we go to the wars again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alice coloured like a damask rose, and hid her face behind her friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hast seen him, sweet?&rsquo; asked Esclairmonde, when Salisbury
had been called away.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is he here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; out there&mdash;he with the white bull on his surcoat,&rsquo;
said Alice, dreading to look that way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And hast spoken with him?&rsquo; asked the lady next, feeling
as if the stout, commonplace, hardy-looking soldier she saw was scarce
what she would have chosen for her little wild rose of an Alice, comely
and brave though he were.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He hath kissed mine hand,&rsquo; faltered Alice, but it was
quite credible that not a word had passed.&nbsp; The marriage was a
business contract between the houses of Wark and Raby, and a grand speculation
for Sir Richard Nevil, that was all; but gentle Alice had no reluctance
beyond mere maidenly shyness, and unwillingness to enter on an unknown
future under a new lord.&nbsp; She even whispered to her dear Clairette
that she was glad Sir Richard never tormented her by talking to her,
and that he was grave, and so old.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So old? why, little one, he can scarce be seven-and-twenty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is not that old? oh, so old!&rsquo; said Alice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Able to take care of me.&nbsp; I would not have a youth like
that young Lord of Glenuskie.&nbsp; Oh no&mdash;never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is well,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, smiling; &lsquo;but
wherefore put such disdain in thy voice, Alice?&nbsp; He used to be
our playfellow, and he hath grown older and more manly in this year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His boyhood was better than such manhood,&rsquo; said Alice;
&lsquo;he was more to my taste when he was meek, than now that he seems
to say, &ldquo;I would be saucy if I durst.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he hath
not the stuff to dare any way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fie! fie!&nbsp; Alice, you are growing slanderous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, now, Clairette, own verily&mdash;you feel the like!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, silly one, what skills it?&nbsp; Youths must pass through
temptation; and if his king hindered his vocation, maybe the poor lad
may rue it sorely, but methinks he will come to the right at last.&nbsp;
It were better to say a prayer for his faults than to speak evil of
them, Alice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Malcolm!&nbsp; He was at that very moment planning with an embroiderer
a robe wherein to appear, covered with flashes of lightning transfixing
the world, and mottoes around&mdash;&lsquo;Esclair&eacute; mais Embras&eacute;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Every moment that he was absent from Esclairmonde was spent in composing
chivalrous discourses in which to lay himself at her feet, but the mere
sight of her steady dark eyes scattered them instantly from his memory;
and save for very shame he would have entreated King James again to
break the ice for him, since the lady evidently supposed that she had
last year entirely quashed his suit.&nbsp; And in this mood Malcolm
mounted and took his place to ride into Paris, where the King wished
to arrive in the evening, and with little preparation, so as to avoid
the weary length of a state reception, with all its speeches and pageants.</p>
<p>In the glow of a May evening the cavalcade passed the gates, and
entered the city, where the streets were so narrow that it was often
impossible to ride otherwise than two and two.&nbsp; The foremost had
emerged into an open space before a church and churchyard, when there
was a sudden pause, a shock of surprise.&nbsp; All across the space,
blocking up the way, was an enormous line of figures, looking shadowy
in the evening light, and bearing the insignia of every rank and dignity
that earth presented.&nbsp; Popes were there, with triple crown and
keys, and fanned by peacock tails; scarlet-matted and caped cardinals,
mitred and crosiered bishops, crowned and sceptred kings, ermined dukes,
steel-clad knights, gowned lawyers, square-capped priests, cowled monks,
and friars of every degree&mdash;nay, the mechanic with his tools, the
peasant with his spade, even the beggar within his dish; old men, and
children of every age; and women too of all grades&mdash;the tower-crowned
queen, the beplumed dame, the lofty abbess, the veiled nun, the bourgeoise,
the peasant, the beggar;&mdash;all were there, moving in a strange shadowy
wild dance, sometimes slow, sometimes swift and mad with gaiety, to
the music of an unseen band of clashing kettle-drums, cymbals, and other
instruments, that played fast and furiously; while above all a knell
in the church tower rang forth at intervals a slow, deep, lugubrious
note; and all the time there glided in and out through the ring a grisly
being&mdash;skull-headed, skeleton-boned, scythe in hand&mdash;Death
himself; and ever and anon, when the dance was swiftest, would he dart
into the midst, pounce on one or other, holding an hour-glass to the
face, unheeding rank, sex, or age, and bear his victim to the charnel-house
beside the church.&nbsp; It was a sight as though some terrible sermon
had taken life, as though the unseen had become visible, the veil were
taken away; and the implicit unresisting obedience of the victims added
to the sense of awful reality and fatality.</p>
<p>The advance of the victorious King Henry made no difference to the
continuousness of the frightful dance; nay, it was plain that he was
but in the presence of a monarch yet more victorious than himself, and
the mazes wound on, the performers being evidently no phantoms, but
as substantial as those who beheld them; nay, the grisly ring began
to absorb the royal suite within itself, and an awe-stricken silence
prevailed&mdash;at least, where Malcolm Stewart and Ralf Percy were
riding together.</p>
<p>Neither lad durst ask the other what it meant.&nbsp; They thought
they knew too well.&nbsp; Percy ceased not for one moment to cross himself,
and mutter invocations to the saints; Malcolm&rsquo;s memory and tongue
alike seemed inert and paralyzed with horror&mdash;his brain was giddy,
his eyes stretched open; and when Death suddenly turned and darted in
his direction, one horrible gush of thought&mdash;&lsquo;Fallen, fallen!&nbsp;
Lost, lost!&nbsp; No confession!&rsquo;&mdash;came over him; he would
have sobbed out an entreaty for mercy and for a priest, but it became
a helpless shriek; and while Percy&rsquo;s sword flashed before his
eyes, he felt himself falling, death-stricken, to the earth, and knew
no more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&mdash;he moved,&rsquo; said a voice above him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How now, Glenuskie?&rsquo; cried Ralf Percy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look
up; I verily thought you were sped by Death in bodily shape; but &rsquo;twas
all an abominable grisly pageant got up by some dismal caitiffs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the Danse Macabre,&rsquo; added the sweet tone that
did indeed unclose Malcolm&rsquo;s eyes, to see Esclairmonde bending
over him, and holding wine to his lips.&nbsp; Ralf raised him that he
might swallow it, and looking round, he saw that he was in a small wainscoted
chamber, with an old burgher woman, Ralf Percy, and Esclairmonde; certainly
not in the other world.&nbsp; He strove to ask &lsquo;what it meant,&rsquo;
and Esclairmonde spoke again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the Danse Macabre; I have seen it in Holland.&nbsp;
It was invented as a warning to those of sinful life, and this good
woman tells me it has become the custom to enact it every evening at
this churchyard of the Holy Innocents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A custom I devoutly hope King Harry will break!&rsquo; exclaimed
Ralf.&nbsp; &lsquo;If not, I&rsquo;ll some day find the way between
those painted ribs of Monseigneur de la Mort, I can tell him!&nbsp;
I had nearly given him a taste of my sword as it was, only some Gascon
rogue caught my arm, and he was off ere I could get free.&nbsp; So I
jumped off, that your poor corpse should not be trodden by French heels;
and I hardly know how it was, but the Lady Esclairmonde was by my side
as I dragged you out, and caused these good folks to let me bring you
in behind their shop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady, lady, I am for ever beholden,&rsquo; cried Malcolm,
gathering himself up as if to fall at her feet, and his heart bounding
high with joy, for this was from death to life indeed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw there was some one hurt,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde in
her repressive manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Drink some more wine, eat this bread,
and you will be able to ride to the H&ocirc;tel de St. Pol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, lady, let me speak of my bliss!&rsquo; and he snatched
at her hand, but was still so dizzy that he sank back, becoming aware
that he was stiff and bruised from his fall.&nbsp; Almost at the same
moment a new step and voice were heard in the little open booth where
the cutler displayed his wares, and King James was at once admitted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How goes it, laddie?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;They told
me grim Death had clutched you and borne you off to his charnel-house;
but at least I see an angel has charge of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde slightly coloured as she made answer:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw some one fall, and came to offer my poor skill, Sir;
but as the Sieur de Glenuskie is fast recovering, if you will permit
Sir Nigel Baird to attend me, Sir, I will at once return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am ready&mdash;I am not hurt.&nbsp; Oh, let us go together!&rsquo;
panted Malcolm, leaping up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, gentlemen!&rsquo; exclaimed the hospitable cutler&rsquo;s
wife; &lsquo;you will not away so fast!&nbsp; This gallant knight will
permit you to remain.&nbsp; And the fair lady, she will do me the honour
to drink a cup of wine to the recovery of her betrothed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so, good woman,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, a little apart,
&lsquo;I am the betrothed of Heaven.&nbsp; I only assisted because I
feared the youth&rsquo;s fall was more serious than it proves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bourgeoise begged pardon, and made a curtsey; there was nothing
unusual in the avowal the lady had made, when the convent was a thoroughly
recognized profession; but Esclairmonde could not carry out her purpose
of departing separately with old Sir Nigel Baird; Malcolm was on his
feet, quite ready to mount, and there was no avoiding the being assisted
to her saddle by any but the King, who was in truth quite as objectionable
a companion, as far as appearances went, for a young solitary maiden,
as was Malcolm himself.&nbsp; Esclairmonde felt that her benevolence
might have led her into a scrape.&nbsp; When she had seen the fall,
knowing that to the unprepared the ghastly pageant must seem reality,
she had obeyed the impulse to hurry to the rescue, to console and aid
in case of injury, and she had not even perceived that her female companions
did not attempt to accompany her.&nbsp; However, the mischance could
best be counteracted by simplicity and unconsciousness; so, as she found
herself obliged to ride by the King, she unconcernedly observed that
these fantastic dances might perhaps arouse sinners, but that they were
a horrible sight for the unprepared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very like a dream becoming flesh and blood,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We in advance were slow to perceive what it was, and then the
King merely thought whether it would alarm the Queen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trow it did not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; the thing has not been found that will stir her placid
face.&nbsp; She merely said it was very lugubrious, and an ill turn
in the Parisians thus to greet her, but they were always senseless <i>b&ecirc;tes</i>;
and he, being relieved of care for her, looked with all his eyes, with
a strange mixture of drollery at the antics and the masques, yet of
grave musing at the likeness to this present life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, &lsquo;that King Henry
is one of the few men to whom the spectacle <i>is</i> a sermon.&nbsp;
He laughs even while he lays a thing to heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These few sentences had brought them to the concourse around the
gateway of the great H&ocirc;tel de St. Pol, in whose crowded courtyard
Esclairmonde had to dismount; and, after being handed through the hall
by King James, to make her way to the ladies&rsquo; apartments, and
there find out, what she was most anxious about, how Alice, who had
been riding at some distance from her with her father, had fared under
the alarm.</p>
<p>Alice ran up to her eagerly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, dear Clairette, and
was he greatly hurt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not much; he had only swooned for fright.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swooned! to be a prince, and not have the heart of a midge!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how was it with you, you very wyvern for courage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With me?&nbsp; Oh, I was somewhat appalled at first, when
my father took hold of my rein, and bade me never fear; for I saw his
face grow amazed.&nbsp; Sir Richard Nevil rode up on the other side,
and said the hobgoblins should eat out his heart ere they hurt me; and
I looked into his face as he said that, and liked it more than ever
I thought to like any but yours, Clairette.&nbsp; I think my father
was going to leave me to him and see whether the King needed some one
to back him; but up came a French lord, and said &rsquo;twas all a mere
show, and my father said he was glad I was a stout-hearted wench that
had never cried out for fear; and then I was so pleased, that I never
heeded the ugly sight any more.&nbsp; Ay, and when Sir Richard lifted
me off my horse, he kissed my hand of his own accord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is all he has ever said to you?&rsquo; said Esclairmonde,
smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is like an Englishman&mdash;to the purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, is it not?&nbsp; Oh! is it not better than all the fine
speeches and compliments that Joan Beaufort gets from her Scottish king?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have truths in them too, child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay; but too fine-spun, too minstrel-like, for a plain English
maid.&nbsp; The hobgoblins should eat out his heart ere they touched
me!&rsquo; she repeated to herself, as though the saying were the most
poetical concert sung on minstrel lover&rsquo;s lute.</p>
<p>Death&rsquo;s Dance had certainly brought this affianced pair to
a better understanding than all the gayest festivities of the Court.</p>
<p>Esclairmonde would have been happy if no one had noticed her benevolence
to the young Scot save Alice Montagu; but she had to endure countless
railleries from every lady, from Countess Jaqueline downwards, on the
unmistakable evidence that her heart had spoken; and her grave dignity
had less effect in silencing them than usual, so diverting was the alleged
triumph over her propriety, well as they knew that she would have done
the same for the youngest horse-boy, or the oldest man-at-arms.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X: THE WHITSUNTIDE FESTIVAL</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Lady, fairest lady!&nbsp; Ah, suffer your slave to fall at
your feet with his thanks!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No thanks are due, Sir.&nbsp; I knew not who had fallen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cruel coyness!&nbsp; Take not away the joy that has fed a
hungry heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Glenuskie&rsquo;s heart was wont to hunger for better
joys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady, I have ceased to be a foolish boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such foolishness was better than some men&rsquo;s wisdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen, belle demoiselle.&nbsp; I have been forth into the
world, and have learnt to see that monasteries have become mere haunts
for the sluggard, who will not face the world; and that honour, glory,
and all that is worth living for, lie beyond.&nbsp; Ah, lady! those
eyes first taught me what life could give.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, Sir!&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can believe
that as a child you mistook your vocation, and the secular life may
be blest to you; but with me it can never be so; and if any friendship
were shown to you on my part, it was when I deemed that we were brother
and sister in our vows.&nbsp; If I unwittingly inspired any false hopes,
I must do penance for the evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Call it not evil, lady,&rsquo; entreated Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
cannot be evil to have wakened me to life and hope and glory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What should you call it in him who should endeavour to render
Lady Joan Beaufort faithless to your king, Lord Malcolm?&nbsp; What
then must it be to tempt another to break troth-plight to the King of
Heaven?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, madame,&rsquo; faltered Malcolm; &lsquo;but if such troth
were forbidden and impossible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None has the right or power to cancel mine,&rsquo; replied
the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; he still entreated, &lsquo;your kindred are mighty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But my Bridegroom is mightier,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O lady, yet&mdash;Say, at least,&rsquo; cried Malcolm, eagerly,
&lsquo;that were you free in your own mind to wed, at least you would
less turn from me than from the others proposed to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That were saying little for you,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde,
half smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;But, Sir,&rsquo; she added gravely, &lsquo;you
have no right to put the question; and I will say nothing on which you
can presume.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were kinder to me in England,&rsquo; sighed Malcolm, with
tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you seemed as one like-minded,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; he cried, gathering fresh ardour, &lsquo;I would
be like-minded again.&nbsp; You would render me so, sweetest lady.&nbsp;
I would kiss your every step, pray with you, bestow alms with you, found
churches, endow your B&eacute;guines, and render our change from our
childish purpose a blessing to the whole world; become your very slave,
to do your slightest bidding.&nbsp; O lady, could I but give you my
eyes to see what it might be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It could not be, if we began with a burthened conscience,&rsquo;
said Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have had enough of this, Sieur de
Glenuskie.&nbsp; You know that with me it is no matter of likes or dislikes,
but that I am under a vow, which I will never break!&nbsp; Make way,
Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could but obey: she was far too majestic and authoritative to
be gainsaid.&nbsp; And Malcolm, in an access of misery, stood lost to
all the world, kneeling in the window-seat, where she had left him resting
his head against the glass, when suddenly a white plump hand was laid
on his shoulder, and a gay voice cried:</p>
<p>&lsquo;All <i>&agrave; la mort</i>, my young damoiseau!&nbsp; What,
has our saint been unpropitious?&nbsp; Never mind, you shall have her
yet.&nbsp; We will see her like the rest of the world, ere we have done
within her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Malcolm found himself face to face with the free-spoken Jaqueline
of Hainault.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very good, madame,&rsquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall think me very good yet!&nbsp; I have no notion of
being opposed by a little vassal of mine; and we&rsquo;ll succeed, if
it were but for the fun of the thing!&nbsp; Monseigneur de Th&eacute;rouenne
is on your side, or would be, if he were sure of the Duke of Burgundy.&nbsp;
You see, these prelates hate nothing so much as the religious orders;
and all the pride of the Luxemburgs is in arms against Clairette&rsquo;s
fancy for those beggarly nursing Sisters; so it drives him mad to hear
her say she only succoured you for charity.&nbsp; He thinks it a family
disgrace, that can only be wiped off by marrying her to you; and he
would do it <i>bon gr&eacute;, mal gr&eacute;</i>, but that he waits
to hear what Burgundy will say.&nbsp; You have only to hold out, and
she shall be yours, if I hold her finger while you put on the ring.&nbsp;
Only let us be sure of Burgundy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was not a very flattering way of obtaining a bride; but Malcolm
was convinced that when once married to Esclairmonde, his devotion would
atone to her for all that was unpleasant in obtaining her.&nbsp; At
least, she loved no one else; she had even allowed that she had once
thought him like-minded; she had formerly distinguished him; and nothing
lay between them but her scruples; and when they were overcome, by whatever
means, his idol would be his, to adore, to propitiate, to win by the
most intense devotion.&nbsp; All now must, however, turn upon the Duke
of Burgundy, without whose sanction Madame of Hainault would be afraid
to act openly.</p>
<p>The Duke was expected at Paris for the Whitsuntide festival, which
was to be held with great state.&nbsp; The custom was for the Kings
of France to feast absolutely with all Paris, with interminable banquet
tables, open to the whole world without question.&nbsp; And to this
Henry had conformed on his first visit to the city; but he had learnt
that the costly and lavish feast had been of very little benefit to
the really distressed, who had been thrust aside by loud-voiced miscreants
and sturdy beggars, such as had no shame in driving the feeble back
with blows, and receiving their own share again and again.</p>
<p>By the advice of Dr. Bennet, his almoner, he was resolved that this
should not happen again; that the feast should be limited to the official
guests, and that the cost of the promiscuous banquet should be distributed
to those who really needed it, and who should be reached through their
parish priests and the friars known to be most charitable.</p>
<p>Dr. Bennet, as almoner, with the other chaplains, was to arrange
the matter; and horrible was the distress that he discovered in the
city, that had for five-and-twenty years been devastated by civil fury,
as well as by foreign wars; and famines, pestilences, murders, and tyrannies
had held sway, so as to form an absolute succession of reigns of terror.&nbsp;
The poor perished like flies in a frost; the homeless orphans of the
parents murdered by either faction roamed the streets, and herded in
the corners like the vagrant dogs of Eastern cities; and meantime, the
nobles and their partisans revelled in wasteful pomp.</p>
<p>Scholar as he was, Dr. Bennet was not familiar enough with Parisian
ways not to be very grateful for aid from Esclairmonde in some of his
conferences, and for her explanations of the different tastes and needs
of French and English poor.</p>
<p>What she saw and heard, on the other hand, gave form and purpose
to her aspirations.&nbsp; The Dutch Sisters of St. Bega, the English
Bedeswomen of St. Katharine, were sorely needed at Paris.&nbsp; They
would gather up the sufferers, collect the outcast children, feed the
hungry, follow with balm wherever a wound had been.&nbsp; To found a
B&eacute;guinage at Paris seemed to her the most befitting mode of devoting
her wealth; and her little admirer, Alice, gave up her longing desire
that the foundation should be in England, when she learned that, as
the wife of Nevil, her abode was likely to be in France as long as that
country required English garrisons.</p>
<p>To the young heiress of Salisbury, her own marriage, though close
at hand, seemed a mere ordinary matter compared with Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
B&eacute;guinage, to her the real romance.&nbsp; Never did she see a
beggar crouching at the church door, without a whisper to herself that
there was a subject for the B&eacute;guines; and, tender-hearted as
she was, she looked quite gratified at any lamentable tale which told
the need.</p>
<p>If Esclairmonde had a climax to her visions of her brown-robed messengers
of mercy, it was that the holy Canon of St. Agnes should be induced
to come and act the part of master to her bedeswomen, as did Master
Kedbesby at home.</p>
<p>She had even dared to murmur her design to Dr. Bennet; and when he,
under strict seal of secrecy, had sounded King Henry, the present real
master of Paris, he reported that the tears had stood in the King&rsquo;s
eyes for a moment, as he said, &lsquo;Blessings on the maiden!&nbsp;
Should she be able to do this for this city, I shall know that Heaven
hath indeed sent a blessing by my arms!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For one brief week, Esclairmonde and Alice were very happy in this
secret hope; but at the end of that time the Bishop of Th&eacute;rouenne
appeared.&nbsp; Esclairmonde had ventured to hope that the King&rsquo;s
influence, and likewise the fact that her intention was not to enrich
one of the regular monastic orders, might lead him to lend a favourable
ear to her scheme; but she was by no means prepared to find him already
informed of the affair of the Dance of Death, and putting his own construction
on it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, my fair cousin, this is the end of your waywardness.&nbsp;
The tokens were certainly somewhat strong; but the young gentleman&rsquo;s
birth being equal to yours, after the spectacle you have presented,
your uncle of St. Pol, and I myself, must do our utmost to obtain the
consent of the Duke of Burgundy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monseigneur is mistaken,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Child, we will have no more folly.&nbsp; You have flown after
this young Scot in a manner fitted only for the foolish name your father
culled for you out of his books of chivalry.&nbsp; You have given a
lesson to the whole Court and city on the consequences of a damsel judging
for herself, and running a mad course over the world, instead of submitting
to her guardians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Court understands my purpose as well as you do, Monseigneur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence, Mademoiselle.&nbsp; Your convent obstinacy is ended
for ever now, since to send you to one would be to appear to hide a
scandal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not wish to enter a convent,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My desire is to dedicate my labour and my substance to the foundation
of a house here at Paris, such as are the B&eacute;guinages of our Netherlands,&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop held up his hands.&nbsp; He had never heard of such lunacy
and it angered him, as such purposes are wont to anger worldly-hearted
men.&nbsp; That a lady of Luxemburg should have such vulgar tastes as
to wish to be a Beguine was bad enough; but that Netherlandish wealth
should be devoted to support the factious poor of Paris was preposterous.&nbsp;
Neither the Duke of Burgundy, nor her uncle of St. Pol, would allow
a sou to pass out of their grasp for so absurd a purpose; the Pope would
give no license&mdash;above all to a vain girl, who had helped a wife
to run away from her husband&mdash;for new religious houses; and, unless
Esclairmonde was prepared to be landless, penniless, and the scorn of
every one, for her wild behaviour, she must submit, <i>bon gr&eacute;,
mal gr&eacute;</i>, to become the wife of the Scottish prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Landless and penniless then will I be, Monseigneur,&rsquo;
said Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was not poverty the bride of St. Francis?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop made a growl of contempt; but recollecting himself, and
his respect for the saint, began to argue that what was possible for
a man, a mere merchant&rsquo;s son, an inspired saint besides, was not
possible to a damsel of high degree, and that it was mere presumption,
vanity, and obstinacy in her to appeal to such a precedent.</p>
<p>There was something in this that struck Esclairmonde, for she was
conscious of a certain satisfaction in her plan of being the first to
introduce a B&eacute;guinage at Paris, and that she was to a certain
degree proud of her years of constancy to her high purpose; and she
looked just so far abashed that the uncle saw his advantage, and discoursed
on the danger of attempting to be better than other people, and of trying
to vapour in spiritual heights, to all of which she attempted no reply;
till at last he broke up the interview by saying, &lsquo;There, then,
child; all will be well.&nbsp; I see you are coming to a better mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I am, Monseigneur,&rsquo; she replied, with lofty meekness;
&lsquo;but scarcely such as you mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alice Montagu&rsquo;s indignation knew no bounds.&nbsp; What! was
this noble votaress to be forced, not only to resign the glory of being
the foundress of a new order of beneficence, but to be married, just
like everybody else, and to that wretched little coward?&nbsp; Bo&euml;mond
of Burgundy was better than that, for he at least was a man!</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Alice,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, with a shudder; &lsquo;any
one rather than the Burgundian!&nbsp; It is shame even to compare the
Scot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may not be so evil in himself,&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;but
with a brave man you have only his own sins, while a coward has all
those other people may frighten him into.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He bore himself manfully in battle,&rsquo; said the fair Fleming
in reproof.</p>
<p>But Alice answered with the scorn that sits so quaintly on the gentle
daughter of a bold race: &lsquo;Ay, where he would have been more afraid
to run than to stand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are hard on the Scot,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Maybe it is because the Nevils of Raby are Borderers,&rsquo;
she added, smiling; and, as Alice likewise smiled and blushed, &lsquo;Now,
if it were not for this madness, I could like the youth.&nbsp; I would
fain have had him for a brother that I could take care of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what will you do, Esclairmonde?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust,&rsquo; said she, sighing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Maybe, my pride
ought to be broken; and I may have to lay aside all my hopes and plans,
and become a mere serving sister, to learn true humility.&nbsp; Anyhow,
I verily trust to my Heavenly Spouse to guard me for himself.&nbsp;
If the Duke of Burgundy still maintains Bo&euml;mond&rsquo;s suit, then
in the dissension I see an escape.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And my father will defend you; and so will Sir Richard,&rsquo;
said Alice, with complacent certainty in their full efficiency.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And King Harry will interfere; and we <i>will</i> have your hospital;
ay, we <i>will</i>.&nbsp; How can you talk so lightly of abandoning
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only would know what is human pride, and what God&rsquo;s
will,&rsquo; sighed Esclairmonde.</p>
<p>The Duke arrived with his two sisters, his wife being left at home
in bad health, and took up his abode at the H&ocirc;tel de Bourgogne,
whence he came at once to pay his respects to the King of England; the
poor King of France, at the Hotel de St. Pol, being quite neglected.</p>
<p>Esclairmonde and Alice stood at a window, and watched the arrival
of the magnificent cavalcade, attended by a multitude, ecstatically
shouting, &lsquo;Noel Noel!&nbsp; Long live Philippe le Bon!&nbsp; Blessings
on the mighty Duke!&rsquo;&nbsp; While seated on a tall charger, whose
great dappled head, jewelled and beplumed, could alone be seen amid
his sweeping housings, bowing right and left, waving his embroidered
gloved hand in courtesy, was seen the stately Duke, in the prime of
life, handsome-faced, brilliantly coloured, dazzlingly arrayed in gemmed
robes, so that Alice drew a long breath of wonder and exclaimed, &lsquo;This
Duke is a goodly man; he looks like the emperor of us all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But when he had entered the hall, conducted by John of Bedford and
Edmund of March, had made his obeisance to Henry, and had been presented
by him to King James, Alice, standing close behind her queen, recollected
that she had once heard Esclairmonde say, &lsquo;Till I came to England
I deemed chivalry a mere gaudy illusion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Duke Philippe would not bear close inspection; the striking features
and full red lips, that had made so effective an appearance in the gay
procession seen from a distance, seemed harsh, haughty, and sensual
near at hand, and when brought into close contact with the strange bright
stern purity, now refined into hectic transparency, of King Henry&rsquo;s
face, the grand and melancholy majesty of the royal Stewart&rsquo;s,
or even the spare, keen, irregular visage of John of Bedford.&nbsp;
And while his robes were infinitely more costly than&mdash;and his ornaments
tenfold outnumbered&mdash;all that the three island princes wore, yet
no critical eye could take him for their superior, even though his tone
in addressing an inferior was elaborately affable and condescending,
and theirs was always the frankness of an equal.&nbsp; Where they gave
the sense of pure gold, he seemed like some ruder metal gilt and decorated;
as if theirs were reality, his the imitation; theirs the truth, his
the display.</p>
<p>But in reality his birth was as princely as theirs; and no monarch
in Europe, not even Henry, equalled him in material resources; he was
idolized by the Parisians; and Henry was aware that France had been
made over to England more by his revenge for his father&rsquo;s murder
at Montereau than by the victory at Agincourt.&nbsp; Therefore the King
endured his grand talk about <i>our</i> arms and <i>our</i> intentions;
and for Malcolm&rsquo;s sake, James submitted to a sort of patronage,
as if meant to imply that if Philippe the Magnificent chose to espouse
the cause of a captive king, his ransom would be the merest trifle.</p>
<p>When Henry bade him to the Pentecostal banquet, &lsquo;when kings
keep state,&rsquo; he graciously accepted the invitation for himself
and his two sisters, Marguerite, widow of the second short-lived Dauphin,
and Anne, still unmarried; but when Henry further explained his plan
of feasting merely with the orderly, and apportioning the food in real
alms, the Duke by no means approved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feed those mis&eacute;rables!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
gains nothing thereby!&nbsp; They make no noise; whereas if you affront
the others, who know how to cry out, they will revile you like dogs!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not be a slave to the rascaille,&rsquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, my fair lord, you, a victor, may dispense with these cares;
but for a poor little prince like me, it is better to reign in men&rsquo;s
hearts than on their necks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the hearts of honest men&mdash;on the necks of knaves,&rsquo;
said Henry.</p>
<p>Philippe shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; He was wise in his own generation;
for he had all the audible voices in Paris on his side, while the cavils
at Henry&rsquo;s economy have descended to the present time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you see your rival, Sir?&rsquo; said the voice of the Bishop
of Th&eacute;rouenne in Malcolm&rsquo;s ear, just as the Duke had begun
to rise to take leave; and he pointed out a knight of some thirty years,
glittering with gay devices from head to foot, and showing a bold proud
visage, exaggerating the harshness of the Burgundian lineaments.</p>
<p>Malcolm shuddered, and murmured, &lsquo;Such a pearl to such a hog!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And meanwhile, King James, stepping forward, intimated to the Duke
that he would be glad of an interview with him.</p>
<p>Philippe made some ostentation of his numerous engagements with men
of Church and State; but ended by inviting the King of Scotland to sup
with him that evening, if his Grace would forgive travellers&rsquo;
fare and a simple reception.</p>
<p>Thither accordingly James repaired on foot, attended only by Sir
Nigel and Malcolm, with a few archers of the royal guard, in case torches
should be wanted on the way home.</p>
<p>How magnificent were the surroundings of the great Duke, it would
be wearisome to tell.&nbsp; The retainers in the court of the hotel
looked, as James said, as if honest steel and good cloth were reckoned
as churls, and as if this were the very land of Cockaigne, as Sir Richard
Whittington had dreamt it.&nbsp; Neither he nor St. Andrew himself would
know their own saltire made in cloth of silver, &lsquo;the very metal
to tarnish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Nigel had to tell their rank, ere the porters admitted the small
company: but the seneschal marshalled them forward in full state.&nbsp;
And James never looked more the king than when, in simple crimson robe,
the pure white cross on his breast, his auburn hair parted back from
his noble brow, he stood towering above all heads, passively receiving
the Duke of Burgundy&rsquo;s elaborate courtesies and greetings, nor
seeming to note the lavish display of gold and silver, meant to amaze
the poorest king in Europe.</p>
<p>Exceeding was the politeness shown to him&mdash;even to the omission
of the seneschal&rsquo;s tasting each dish presented to the Duke, a
recognition of the presence of a sovereign that the two Scots scarcely
understood enough for gratitude.</p>
<p>Malcolm was the best off of the two at the supper; for James had
of course to be cavalier to the sickly fretful-looking Dauphiness, while
Malcolm fell to the lot of the Lady Anne, who, though not beautiful,
had a kindly hearty countenance and manner, and won his heart by asking
whether the Demoiselle de Luxemburg were still in the suite of Madame
of Hainault; and then it appeared that she had been her convent mate
and warmest friend and admirer in their girlish days at Dijon, and was
now longing to see her.&nbsp; Was she as much set as ever on being a
nun?</p>
<p>Meantime, the Duke was pompously making way for the King of Scots
to enter his cabinet, where&mdash;with a gold cup before each, a dish
of comfits and a stoup of wine between them&mdash;their interview was
to take place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These dainties accord with a matter of ladies&rsquo; love,&rsquo;
said James, as the Duke handed him a sugar heart transfixed by an arrow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good, good,&rsquo; said Philippe.&nbsp; &lsquo;The alliance
is noble and our crowns and influence might be a good check in the north
to your mighty neighbour; nor would I be hard as to her dowry.&nbsp;
Send me five score yearly of such knaves as came with Buchan, and I
could fight the devil himself.&nbsp; A morning gift might be specified
for the name of the thing&mdash;but we understand one another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not certain of that, Sir,&rsquo; said James, smiling;
&lsquo;though I see you mean me kindly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, now,&rsquo; continued Philippe, &lsquo;I know how to
honour royalty, even in durance; nor will I even press Madame la Dauphine
on you instead of Anne, though it were better for us all if she could
have her wish and become a queen, and you would have her jointure&mdash;if
you or any one else can get it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay, my Lord Duke,&rsquo; said James, with dignity, &lsquo;I
spake not of myself, deeming that it was well known that my troth is
plighted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo; said Burgundy, amazed, but not offended.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Methought the House of Somerset was a mere bastard slip, with
which even King Henry with all his insolence could not expect you to
wed in earnest.&nbsp; However, we may keep our intentions secret awhile;
and then, with your lances and my resources, English displeasure need
concern you little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James, who had learned self-control in captivity, began politely
to express himself highly honoured and obliged.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not mention it.&nbsp; Royal blood, thus shamefully oppressed,
must command the aid of all that is chivalrous.&nbsp; Speak, and your
ransom is at your service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hot blood rushed into James&rsquo;s cheek at this tone of condescension;
but he answered, with courteous haughtiness: &lsquo;Of myself, Sir Duke,
there is no question.&nbsp; My ransom waits England&rsquo;s willingness
to accept it; and my hand is not free, even for the prize you have the
goodness to offer.&nbsp; I came not to speak of myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to make suit for my sister, nor my intercession!&rsquo;
exclaimed Philippe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I make suit to no man,&rsquo; said James; then, recollecting
himself, &lsquo;if I did so, no readier friend than the Duke of Burgundy
could be found.&nbsp; I did in effect come to propose an alliance between
one of my own house and a fair vassal of yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! the runaway jade of Luxemburg!&rsquo; cried Burgundy;
&lsquo;the most headstrong girl who lives!&nbsp; She dared to plead
her foolish vows against my brother Bo&euml;mond, fled with that other
hoyden of Hainault, and now defies me by coming here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
have her, and make her over to Bo&euml;mond to tame her pride, were
she in the great Satan&rsquo;s camp instead of King Henry&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And this is the mirror of chivalry! thought James.&nbsp; But he persevered
in his explanation of his arrangement for permitting the estates of
Esclairmonde de Luxemburg to be purchased from her and her husband,
should that husband be Malcolm Stewart of Glenuskie; and he soon found
that these terms would be as acceptable to the Duke as they had already
proved to her guardian, Monseigneur de Th&eacute;rouenne.&nbsp; Money
was nothing to Philippe; but his policy was to absorb the little seignoralties
that lay so thick in these border lands of the Empire; and what he desired
above all, was to keep them from either passing into the hands of the
Church, or from consolidating into some powerful principality, as would
have been the case had Esclairmonde either entered a convent or married
young Waleran de Luxemburg, her cousin.&nbsp; Therefore he had striven
to force on her his half-brother, who would certainly never unite any
inheritance to hers; but he much preferred the purchase of her Hainault
lands; and had no compunction in throwing over Bo&euml;mond, except
for a certain lurking desire that the lady&rsquo;s contumacy should
be chastised by a lord who would beat her well into subjection.&nbsp;
He would willingly have made a great show of generosity, and have laid
James under an obligation; and yet by the King&rsquo;s dignified tone
of courtesy he was always reduced to the air of one soliciting rather
than conferring a favour.</p>
<p>Finally, Malcolm was called in, and presented to the Duke, making
his own promise on his word of honour as a prince, and giving a written
bond, that so soon as he obtained the hand of the Demoiselle de Luxemburg
he would resign her Hainault estates to the Duke of Burgundy for a sum
of money, to be fixed by persons chosen for the purpose.</p>
<p>This was more like earnest than anything Malcolm had yet obtained;
and he went home exulting and exalted, his doubts as to Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
consent almost silenced, when he counted up the forces that were about
to bear upon her.</p>
<p>And they did descend upon her.&nbsp; Countess Jaqueline had been
joined by other and more congenial Flemish dames, and was weary of her
grave monitress; and she continually scolded at Esclairmonde for perverseness
and obstinacy in not accepting the only male thing she had ever favoured.&nbsp;
The Bishop of Th&eacute;rouenne threatened and argued; and the Duke
of Burgundy himself came to enforce his commands to his refractory vassal,
and on finding her still unsubmissive, flew into a rage, and rated her
as few <i>could</i> have done, save Philippe, called the Good.</p>
<p>All she attempted to answer was, that they were welcome to her lands,
so they would leave her person free; her vows were not to man, but to
God, and God would protect her.</p>
<p>It was an answer that seemed specially to enrage her persecutors,
who retorted by telling her that such protection was only extended to
those who obeyed lawful authority; and hints were thrown out that, if
she did not submit willingly, she might find herself married forcibly,
for a bishop could afford to disregard the resistance of a bride.</p>
<p>Would Malcolm&mdash;would his king&mdash;consent to her being thus
treated?</p>
<p>As to Malcolm, he seemed to her too munch changed for her to reckon
on what remnant of good feeling there might be to appeal to in him.&nbsp;
And James, though he was certain not to permit palpable coercion in
his presence, or even if he were aware that it was contemplated, seemed
to have left the whole management of the affair to Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
own guardians; and they would probably avoid driving matters to extremities
that would revolt him, while he was near enough for an appeal.&nbsp;
And Esclairmonde was too uncertain whether her guardians would resort
to such lengths, or whether it were not a vain threat of the giddy Countess,
to compromise her dignity by crying out before she was hurt; and she
had no security, save that she was certain that in the English household
of King Henry such violence would not be attempted; and out of reach
of that protection she never ventured.</p>
<p>Once she said to Henry, &lsquo;My only hope is in God and in you,
my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Henry bent his head, saying, &lsquo;Noble lady, I cannot interfere;
but while you are in my house, nothing can be done with you against
your will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet even Henry was scarcely what he had been in all-pervading vigilance
and readiness.&nbsp; Like all real kings of men, he had been his own
prime minister, commander-in-chief, and private secretary, transacting
a marvellous amount of business with prompt completeness; and when,
in the midst of shattered health which he would not avow, the cares
of two kingdoms, and the generalship of an army, with all its garrisons,
rested on him, his work would hardly have been accomplished but for
his brother&rsquo;s aid.&nbsp; It was never acknowledged, often angrily
disdained.&nbsp; But when John of Bedford had watched the terrible lassitude
and lethargy that weighed on the King at times in the midst of his cabinet
work, he was constantly on the watch to relieve him; and his hand and
style so closely resembled Henry&rsquo;s that the difference could scarce
be detected, and he could do what none other durst attempt.&nbsp; Many
a time would Henry, whose temper had grown most uncertain, fiercely
rate him for intermeddling; but John knew and loved him too well to
heed; and his tact and unobtrusiveness made Henry rely on him more and
more.</p>
<p>If the illness had only been confessed, those who watched the King
anxiously would have had more hope; but he was hotly angered at any
hint of his needing care; and though he sometimes relieved oppression
by causing himself to be bled by a servant, he never allowed that anything
ailed him; it was always the hot weather, the anxious tidings, the long
pageant that wearied him&mdash;things that were wont to be like gnats
on a lion&rsquo;s mane.</p>
<p>Those solemn banquets and festivals&mdash;lasting from forenoon till
eventide, with their endless relays of allegorical subtleties, their
long-winded harangues, noisy music, interludes of giants, sylvan men,
distressed damsels, knights-errant on horseback, ships and forests coming
in upon wheels, and fulsome compliments that must be answered&mdash;had
been always his aversion, and were now so heavy an oppression that Bedford
would have persuaded the Queen to curtail them.&nbsp; But to the fair
Catherine this appeared an unkind endeavour of her disagreeable brother-in-law,
to prevent her from shining in her native city, and eclipsing the Burgundian
pomp; and she opened her soft brown eyes in dignified displeasure, answering
that she saw nothing amiss with the King; and she likewise complained
to her husband of his brother&rsquo;s jealousy of her welcome from her
own people, bringing on him one of Henry&rsquo;s most bitter sentences.</p>
<p>Henry would only have had her abate somewhat of the splendour that
gratified her, because he did not think it becoming to outshine her
parents; but Catherine scorned the notion.&nbsp; Her old father would
know nothing, or would smile in his foolish way to see her so brave;
and for her mother, she recked not so long as she had a larded capon
before her: nor was it possible to make the young queen understand that
this fatuity and feebleness were the very reasons for deferring to them.</p>
<p>The ordering of the feast fell to Catherine and her train; and its
splendours on successive days had their full development, greatly to
the constraint and weariness, among others, of Esclairmonde, who was
always assigned to Malcolm Stewart, and throughout these long days had
to be constantly repressing him; not that he often durst make her any
direct compliment, for he was usually quelled into anxious wistful silence,
and merely eyed her earnestly, paying her every attention in his power.&nbsp;
And such a silent tedious meal was sure to be remarked, either with
laughing rudeness by Countess Jaqueline, or with severe reproof by the
Bishop of Th&eacute;rouenne, both of whom assured her that she had better
lay aside her airs, and resign herself in good part, for there was no
escape for her.</p>
<p>One day, however, when the feast was at the H&ocirc;tel de Bourgogne,
and there were some slight differences in the order of the guests, the
Duke of Bedford put himself forward as the Lady Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
cavalier, so much to her relief, that her countenance, usually so guarded,
relaxed into the bright, sweet smile of cheerfulness that was most natural
to her.&nbsp; Isolated as the pairs at the table were, and with music
braying in a gallery just above, there was plenty of scope for conversation;
and once again Esclairmonde was talking freely of the matters regarding
the distress in Paris, that Bedford had consulted her upon before he
became so engrossed with his brother&rsquo;s affairs, or she so beset
by her persecutors.</p>
<p>Towards the evening, when the feast had still some mortal hours to
last, there fell a silence on the Duke; and at length, when the music
was at the loudest, he said &lsquo;Lady, I have watched for this moment.&nbsp;
You are persecuted.&nbsp; Look not on me as one of your persecutors;
but if no other refuge be open to you, here is one who might know better
how to esteem you than that malapert young Scot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How, Sir?&rsquo; exclaimed Esclairmonde, amazed at these words
from the woman-hating Bedford.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make no sudden reply,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had
never thought of you save as one consecrate, till, when I see you like
to be hunted down into the hands of yon silly lad, I cannot but thrust
between.&nbsp; My brother would willingly consent; and, if I may but
win your leave to love you, lady, it will be with a heart that has yearned
to no other woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke low and steadily, looking straight before him, with no visible
emotion, save a little quiver in the last sentence, a slight dilating
of the delicately cut nostril; and then he was silent, until, having
recovered the self-restraint that had been failing him, he prevented
the words she was trying to form by saying, &lsquo;Not in haste, lady.&nbsp;
There is time yet before you to bethink yourself whether you can be
free in will and conscience.&nbsp; If so, I will bear you through all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>How invitingly the words fell on the lonely heart, so long left to
fight its own battles!&nbsp; There came for the first time the full
sense of what life might be, the shielding tenderness, the sure reliance,
the pure affection, such as she saw Henry lavish on the shallow Queen,
but which she could meet and requite in John.&nbsp; The brutal Bo&euml;mond,
the childish Malcolm, had aroused no feeling in her but dislike or pity,
and to them a convent was infinitely preferable; but Bedford&mdash;the
religious, manly, brave, unselfish Bedford&mdash;opened to her the view
of all that could content a high-souled woman&rsquo;s heart, backed,
moreover, by the wonder of having been the first to touch such a spirit.</p>
<p>It would not have been a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>.&nbsp; Her family
was one of the grandest of the Netherlands; the saintly Emperor, Henry
of Luxemburg, was her ancestor; and Bedford&rsquo;s proposal was not
a condescension such as to rouse her sense of dignity.&nbsp; His rank
did not strike her as did his lofty stainless character; the like of
which she had never known to exist in the world of active life till
she saw the brothers of England, who came more near to the armed saints
and holy warriors of Church legend than her fancy had thought mortal
man could do, bred as she had been in the sensual, violent, and glittering
Burgundy of the fifteenth century.&nbsp; In truth, as Malcolm had thought
the cloister the only refuge from the harshness and barbarism of Scotland,
so Esclairmonde had thought piety and purity to be found nowhere else;
and both had found the Court of Henry V. an infinitely better world
than they had supposed possible; but, until the present moment, Esclairmonde
had never felt the slightest call to take a permanent place there.&nbsp;
Now however the cloister, even if it were open to her, presented a gloomy,
cheerless life of austerity, in comparison with human affection and
matronly duty.&nbsp; And most vivid of all at the moment was the desire
to awaken the tender sweetness that slept in those steady gray eyes,
to see the grave, wise visage gleam with smiling affection, and to rest
in having one to take thought for her, and finish this long term of
tossing about and self-defence.&nbsp; Was not the patience with which
he kept his eyes away from her already a proof of his consideration
and delicate kindness?</p>
<p>But deep in Esclairmonde&rsquo;s soul lay the sense that her dedication
was sacred, and her power over herself gone.&nbsp; She had always felt
a wife&rsquo;s allegiance due to Him whom she received as her spiritual
Spouse; and though the sense at this moment only brought her disappointment
and self-reproach, her will was loyal.&nbsp; The bond was cutting into
her very flesh, but she never even thought of breaking it; and all she
waited for was the power of restraining her grateful tears.</p>
<p>In this she was assisted by observing that Bedford&rsquo;s attention
had been attracted towards his brother, who was looking wan and weary,
scarcely tasting what was set before him; and, after fitfully trying
to converse with Marguerite of Burgundy, at last had taken advantage
of an endless harangue from all the Virtues, and had dropped asleep.&nbsp;
The Lady Anne was seen making a sign to her sister not to disturb him;
and Bedford murmured, with a sigh, &lsquo;There is, for once, a discreet
woman.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, as if recalled to a sense of what was passing,
he turned on Esclairmonde his full earnest look, saying, &lsquo;You
will teach the Queen how <i>he</i> should be cared for.&nbsp; You will
help me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, feeling it most difficult not
to falter, &lsquo;this is a great grace, but it cannot be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cannot!&rsquo; said Bedford, slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
taken thought?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, it is not the part of a betrothed spouse to take thought.&nbsp;
My vows were renewed of my own free will and it were sacrilege to try
to recall them for the first real temptation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke steadily, but the effort ached through her whole frame,
especially when the last word illumined John Plantagenet&rsquo;s face
with strange sweet light, quenched as his lip trembled, his nostril
quivered, his eye even moistened, as he said, &lsquo;It is enough, lady;
I will no more vex one who is vexed enough already; and you will so
far trust me as to regard me as your protector, if you should be in
need?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed I will,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, hardly restraining
her tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is well,&rsquo; said Bedford.&nbsp; And he neither looked
at her nor spoke to her again, till, as he led her away in the procession
from the hall, he held her hand fast, and murmured: &lsquo;There then
it rests, sweet lady unless, having taken counsel with your own heart,
you should change your decree, and consult some holy priest.&nbsp; If
so, make but a sign of the hand, and I am yours; for verily you are
the only maiden I could ever have loved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was still in utter confusion, in the chamber where the ladies
were cloaking for their return, when her hands were grasped on either
side by the two Burgundian princesses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sweet runaway, we have caught you at last!&nbsp; Here, into
Anne&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; See you we must!&nbsp; How is it with you?&nbsp;
Like you the limping Scot better than Bo&euml;mond?&rsquo; laughed the
Dauphiness, her company dignity laid aside for school-girl chatter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you cannot hold out,&rsquo; said Anne, &lsquo;the Scot
seems a gentle youth; and, at least, you are quit of Bo&euml;mond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Marguerite, &lsquo;his last prank was too
strong for the Duke: quartering a dozen men-at-arms on a sulky Cambrai
weaver till he paid him 2000 crowns.&nbsp; Besides, it would be well
to get the Scottish king for an ally.&nbsp; Do you know what we two
are here for, Clairette?&nbsp; We are both to be betrothed: one to the
handsome captive with the gold locks; the other to your hawk-nosed neighbour,
who seemed to have not a word to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, replying to the easiest part
of the disclosure, &lsquo;the King of Scots is in love with the Demoiselle
of Somerset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What matters that, silly maid?&rsquo; said Marguerite &lsquo;he
does not displease me; and Anne is welcome to that melancholy duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Lady Anne!&rsquo; exclaimed Esclairmonde, &lsquo;if such
be your lot, it would be well indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, the surly brother, of whom Catherine tells such tales!&rsquo;
continued Marguerite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Credit them not,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
never crosses her but when he would open her eyes to his brother&rsquo;s
failing health.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; interrupted Marguerite; &lsquo;my lord brother
swears that this king will not live a year; and if Catherine have no
better luck with her child than poor Michelle, then there will be another
good Queen Anne in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If so,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, looking at her friend with
swimming eyes, &lsquo;she will have the best of husbands&mdash;as good
as even she deserves!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne held her hand fast, and would have said many tender words on
Esclairmonde&rsquo;s own troubles; but the other ladies were arrayed,
and Esclairmonde would not for worlds have been left behind in the H&ocirc;tel
de Bourgogne.</p>
<p>Privacy was not an attainable luxury, and Esclairmonde could not
commune with her throbbing heart, or find peace for her aching head,
till night.&nbsp; This must be a matter unconfided to any, even Alice
Montagu.&nbsp; And while the maiden lay smiling in her quiet sleep,
after having fondly told her friend that Sir Richard Nevil had really
noticed her new silken kirtle, she knelt on beneath the crucifix, mechanically
reciting her prayers, and, as the beads dropped from her fingers, fighting
out the fight with her own heart.</p>
<p>Her mind was made up; but her sense of the loss, her craving for
the worthy affection which lay within her grasp&mdash;these dismayed
her.&nbsp; The life she had sighed for had become a blank; and she passionately
detested the obligation that held her back from affection, usefulness,
joy, and excellence&mdash;not ambition, for the greatest help to her
lay in Bedford&rsquo;s position, his exalted rank, and nearness to the
crown.&nbsp; Indeed, she really dreaded and loathed worldly pomp so
much that the temptation would have been greater had he not been a prince.</p>
<p>It was this sense of renunciation that came to her aid.&nbsp; She
had at least a <i>real</i> sacrifice to offer; till now, as she became
aware, she had made none.&nbsp; She folded her hands, and laid her offering
to be hallowed by the One all-sufficient Sacrifice.&nbsp; She offered
all those capacities for love that had been newly revealed to her; she
offered up the bliss, whose golden dawn she had seen; she tried to tear
out the earthliness of her heart and affections by the roots, and lay
them on the altar, entreating that, come what might, her spirit might
never stray from the Heavenly Spouse of her betrothal.</p>
<p>Therewith came a sense of His perfect sufficiency&mdash;of rest,
peace, support, ineffable love, that kept her kneeling in a calm, almost
ecstatic state, in which common hopes, fears, and affections had melted
away.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI: THE TWO PROMISES</h2>
<p>After all, Alice Montagu was married almost privately, and without
any preparation.&nbsp; Tidings came that the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on
was besieging Cosne, a city belonging to the Duke of Burgundy, and that
instant relief was needed.&nbsp; The Duke was urgent with Henry to save
the place for him, and set off at once to collect his brilliant chivalry;
while Henry, rousing at the trumpet-call, declared that nothing ailed
him but pageants, sent orders to all his troops to collect from different
quarters, and prepared to take the command in person; while reports
daily came in of the great muster the Armagnacs were making, as though
determined to offer battle.</p>
<p>Salisbury was determined not to abide the chances of the battle without
first giving a protector to his little daughter; and therefore, as quietly
as if she had been merely going to mass, the Lady Alice was wedded to
her Sir Richard Nevil, who treated the affair as the simplest matter
of course, and troubled himself with very slight demonstrations of affection.&nbsp;
The wedding took place at Senlis, whither the female part of the Court
had accompanied the King, upon the very day of the parting.&nbsp; No
one was present, except one of Sir Richard&rsquo;s brothers (the whole
family numbered twenty-two), his esquire; and on Alice&rsquo;s side,
her father, Esclairmonde, and a few other ladies.</p>
<p>At the last moment, however, the King himself came up, leaning on
Warwick&rsquo;s arm, looking thin, ill, and flushed, but resolved to
do honour to his faithful Salisbury, at whose request he had permitted
the barony of Montagu to be at once transferred to Nevil, who would
thenceforth be called by that title.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, King Henry kissed the gentle bride, placed a
costly ring upon her finger, and gave his best and warmest wishes to
the newly-married pair.&nbsp; Little guessed any there present what
the sound of Warwick and Salisbury would be in forty years&rsquo; time
to the babe cradled at Windsor.</p>
<p>As the King passed Esclairmonde, he paused, and said, in an undertone,
&lsquo;Dear lady, deem not that I have forgotten your holy purpose;
but you understand that there are some who are jealous of any benefit
conferred on Paris save from themselves, and whose alliance I may not
risk.&nbsp; But if God be pleased to grant me this battle also, then,
with His good pleasure, I shall not be forced to have such respect to
persons; and when I return, lady, whether the endowment come from your
bounty or no, God helping us, you shall begin the holy work of St. Katharine&rsquo;s
bedeswomen among the poor of Paris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But while Henry V., with all his grave sweetness, spoke these words
to Esclairmonde de Luxemburg, this was the farewell of Countess Jaqueline
of Hainault to Malcolm Stewart:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, my languishing swain; never mind her scorn, but
win your spurs in the battle that is to be, and then make some excuse
to get back again to us before the two Kings, with all their scruples.&nbsp;
Then beshrew me but she shall be yours!&nbsp; If Monseigneur de Th&eacute;rouenne
and I cannot manage one proud girl, I am not Countess of Hainault!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This promise sent him away, planning the enjoyment of conquering
Esclairmonde&rsquo;s long resistance, and teaching her where to find
happiness.&nbsp; Should he punish her, by being stern and tyrannical
at first? or should his kindness teach her to repent?&nbsp; When he
was a knight, he would be in a condition to assert his authority, he
thought; and of knighthood both he and Ralf Percy felt almost certain,
in that wholesale dubbing of knights that was wont to be the preliminary
of a battle.&nbsp; To be sure, they had indulged in a good many unlicensed
pleasures at Paris&mdash;Ralf from sheer reckless love of sport, Malcolm
in his endeavour to forget himself, and to be manly; but they had escaped
detection, and they knew plenty of young Englishmen, and many more Burgundians
and Gascons, who had plunged far deeper into mischief, and thought it
no disgrace, but rather held that there was some special dispensation
for the benefit of warriors.</p>
<p>Malcolm and Ralf were riding with a party of these young men.&nbsp;
King Henry had consented to make his first day&rsquo;s journey as far
as Corbeil in a litter, since only there he was to meet the larger number
of his troops, whom Bedford and Warwick were assembling.&nbsp; James
was riding close beside him, with his immediate attendants; and the
two youths, not being needed, had joined their comrades with the advanced
guard of the escort.</p>
<p>It was always a fiction maintained by Henry, that he was marching
in a friendly country; plunder was strictly forbidden, and everything
was to be paid for; but unfortunately, the peasantry on his way never
realized this, and the soldiery often took care they should not.&nbsp;
Therefore, when the advanced guard came to the village that had been
marked out for their halt, instead of finding provisions and forage
to be purchased, they met with only bare walls, and a few stray cats;
and while storming and raving between hunger and disappointment, a report
came from somewhere that the inhabitants had fled, and driven off their
cattle to another village some four miles off, in the woods, on the
heights above.&nbsp; Of course, they must be taught reason.&nbsp; It
was true that the men-at-arms, who were under the command of Sir Christopher
Kitson and Sir William Trenton, were obliged to abide where they were,
much as Kitson growled at being unable to procure a draught of wine
for Trenton, whom he had been nursing for weeks under intermitting fever,
caught at Meaux; but the young gentlemen were well pleased to show themselves
under no Yorkshireman&rsquo;s orders, and galloped off <i>en masse</i>
to procure refreshment for their horses and themselves, further stimulated
by the report that the Armagnacs had left a sick man behind them there,
who might be a valuable prisoner.</p>
<p>By and by, a woodland path brought the disorderly party, about forty
in number, including their servants and the ruffians who always followed
whenever plunder was to be scented, out upon a pretty French village
of the better class, built round a green shaded with chestnuts, under
which, sure enough, were hay-carts, cows, sheep, and goats, and their
owners, taking refuge in a place thought to be out of the track of the
invaders.</p>
<p>Here were the malicious defrauders of the hungry warriors.&nbsp;
Down upon them flew the angry foragers.&nbsp; Soon the pretty tranquil
scene was ringing with the oaths of the plundering and the cries of
the plundered; the cattle were being driven off, the houses and farm-yards
rifled, blood was flowing, and what could not be carried off was burning.&nbsp;
The search for the Armagnac prisoner had, however, relaxed after the
first inquiry, and Malcolm, surprised that this had been forgotten,
suddenly bethought him of the distinction he should secure by sending
a valuable prize to Esclairmonde&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; He seized on an
old man who had not been able to fly, and stood trembling and panting
in a corner, and demanded where the sick man was.&nbsp; The old man
pointed to a farm-house, round which clouds of smoke were rolling, and
Malcolm hurried into it, shouting, &lsquo;Dog of an Armagnac, come out!&nbsp;
Yield, ere thou be burnt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>No answer; and he dashed forward.&nbsp; In the lower room was a sight
that opened his eyes with horror&mdash;no other than the shield of Drummond,
with the three wavy lines; ay, and with it the helmet and suit of armour,
whereof he knew each buckle and brace!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Patie!&nbsp; Patrick!&nbsp; Patrick Drummond!&rsquo; he wildly
shouted, &lsquo;are you there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No answer; and seeing through the smoke a stair, he rushed up.&nbsp;
There, in an upper room, on a bed, lay a senseless form, suffocated
perhaps by the smoke, but unmistakably his cousin!&nbsp; He called to
him, seized him, shook him, dragged him out of bed, all in vain; there
was no sign of animation.&nbsp; The fire was gaining on the house; Malcolm&rsquo;s
own breath was failing, and his frenzied efforts to carry Patrick&rsquo;s
almost giant form to the stairs were quite unavailing.&nbsp; Wild with
horror, he flew shouting down-stairs to call Halbert, whom he had left
with his horse, but neither Halbert nor horse was in sight, nor indeed
any of the party.&nbsp; Not a man was in sight, except a few hurrying
far out of reach, as if something had alarmed them.&nbsp; He wrung his
hands in anguish, and was about to make another attempt to drag Patrick
down from the already burning house, when suddenly a troop of horse
was among the scene of desolation, and at their head King James himself.&nbsp;
Malcolm flew to the King, cutting short his angry exclamation with the
cry, &lsquo;Help! help! he will burn!&nbsp; Patrick!&nbsp; Patie Drummond!&nbsp;
There!&rsquo;</p>
<p>James had scarce gathered the sense of the words, ere, leaping from
his horse, he bounded up the stairs, through the smoke, amid flakes
of burning thatch falling from the roof, groped in the dense clouds
of smoke for the senseless weight, and holding the shoulders while Malcolm
held the feet, they sped down the stair, and rested not till they had
laid him under a chestnut tree, out of reach of the crash of the house,
which fell in almost instantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does he live?&rsquo; gasped Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will not,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;if his nation be
known here.&nbsp; Keep out of his sight!&nbsp; He must hear only French!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Remembering how inexorably Henry hung every Scotch prisoner, Malcolm&rsquo;s
heart sank.&nbsp; This was why no one had sought the prisoner.&nbsp;
A Scot was not available for ransom!&nbsp; Should he be the murderer
of his cousin, Lily&rsquo;s love?</p>
<p>Meantime James hurriedly explained to Kitson that here was the sick
man left by the enemy, summoned Sir Nigel to his side, closed his own
visor, and called for water; then hung over the prisoner, anxious to
prevent the first word from being broad Scotch.&nbsp; In the free air,
some long sobs showed that Patrick was struggling back to life; and
James at once said, &lsquo;Rendez vous, Messire;&rsquo; but he neither
answered, nor was there meaning in his eyes.&nbsp; And James perceived
that he was bandaged as though for broken ribs, and that his right shoulder
was dislocated, and no doubt had been a second time pulled out when
Malcolm had grasped him by the arms.&nbsp; He swooned again at the first
attempt to lift him, and a hay-cart having been left in the flight of
the marauders, he was laid in it, and covered with the King&rsquo;s
cloak, to be conveyed to Corbeil, where James trusted to secure his
life by personal intercession with Henry.&nbsp; He groaned heavily several
times, but never opened his eyes or spoke articulately the whole way;
and James and Sir Nigel kept on either side of the cart, ready to address
him in French the first moment, having told the English that he was
a prisoner of quality, who must be carefully conveyed to King James&rsquo;s
tent at Corbeil.&nbsp; Malcolm was not allowed to approach, lest he
should be recognized; and he rode along in an agony of shame and suspense,
with very different feelings towards Patrick than those with which he
had of late thought of him, or of his own promises.&nbsp; If Patrick
died through this plundering raid, how should he ever face Lily?</p>
<p>It was nearly night ere they reached Corbeil, where the tents were
pitched outside the little town.&nbsp; James committed his captive to
the prudent care of old Baird, bidding him send for a French or Burgundian
surgeon, unable to detect the Scottish tongue; and then, taking Malcolm
with him, he crossed the square in the centre of the camp to the royal
pavilion, opposite to which his own was pitched.</p>
<p>It was a sultry night, and Henry had insisted on sleeping in his
tent, declaring himself sick of stone walls; and as they approached
his voice could be heard in brief excited sentences, giving orders,
and asking for the King of Scots.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, Sir,&rsquo; said James, stopping in where the curtain
was looped up, and showed King Henry half sitting, half lying, on a
couch of cushions and deer-skins, his eyes full of fire, his thin face
flushed with deep colour; Bedford, March, Warwick, and Salisbury in
attendance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho! you are late!&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you
come up with the caitiff robbers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They made off as we rode up.&nbsp; The village was already
burnt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who were they?&nbsp; I hope you hung them on the spot, as
I bade,&rsquo; continued Henry, coughing between his sentences, and
almost in spite of himself, putting his hand to his side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was delayed.&nbsp; There was a life to save: a gentleman
who lay sick and stifled in a burning house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what was it to you,&rsquo; cried Henry, angrily, &lsquo;if
a dozen rebel Armagnacs were fried alive, when I sent you to hinder
my men from growing mere thieves?&nbsp; Gentleman, forsooth!&nbsp; One
would think it the Dauphin himself; or mayhap Buchan.&nbsp; Ha! it is
a Scot, then!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Sir,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;Sir Patrick Drummond,
a good knight, hurt and helpless, for whom I entreat your grace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You disobeyed me to spare a Scot!&rsquo; burst forth Henry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You, who call yourself a captain of mine, and who know my will!&nbsp;
He hangs instantly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harry, bethink yourself.&nbsp; This is no captive taken in
battle.&nbsp; He is a sick man, left behind, sorely hurt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then wherefore must you be meddling, instead of letting him
burn as he deserved, and heeding what you undertook for me?&nbsp; I
<i>will</i> have none of your traitor ruffians here.&nbsp; Since you
have brought him in, the halter for him!&mdash;Here, Ralf Percy, tell
the Provost-marshal&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted, for James unbuckled his sword, and tendered it
to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;King Harry,&rsquo; he said gravely, &lsquo;this morning I
was your friend and brother-in-arms; now I am your captive.&nbsp; Hang
Patrick Drummond, who aided me at Meaux in saving my honour and such
freedom as I have, and I return to any prison you please, and never
strike blow for you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take back your sword,&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
folly is this?&nbsp; You knew that I count not your rebel subjects as
prisoners of war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not know that I was saving a defenceless man from the
flames to be used like a dog.&nbsp; I never offered my arm to serve
a savage tyrant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take your sword!&rsquo; reiterated Henry, his passion giving
way before James&rsquo;s steady calmness.&nbsp; &lsquo;We will look
into it to-morrow: but it was no soldierly act to take advantage of
my weariness, to let my commands be broken the first day of taking the
field, and bring the caitiff here.&nbsp; We will leave him for the night,
I say.&nbsp; Take up your sword.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not till I am sure of my liegeman&rsquo;s life,&rsquo; said
James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No threats, Sir.&nbsp; I will make no promise,&rsquo; said
Henry, haughtily; but the words died away in a racking cough.</p>
<p>And Bedford, laying his hand on James&rsquo;s arm, said, &lsquo;He
is fevered and weary.&nbsp; Fret him no longer, but take your sword,
and get your fellow out of the camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James was too much hurt to make a compromise.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
he said; &lsquo;unless your brother freely spares the life of a man
thus taken, I must be his prisoner&mdash;but his soldier never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He left the tent, followed by Malcolm in an agony of despair and
self-reproach.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s morning decisions were not apt to vary from his evening
ones.&nbsp; There was a terrible implacability about him at times, and
he had never ceased to visit his brother of Clarence&rsquo;s death upon
the Scots, on the plea that they were in arms against their king.&nbsp;
Even Bedford obviously thought that the prisoner would be safest out
of his reach; and this could hardly be accomplished, since Patrick had
been placed in James&rsquo;s tent, in the very centre of the camp, near
the King&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; And though Bedford and March might have
connived at his being taken away, yet the mass of the soldiery would,
if they detected a Scot being smuggled away into the town, have been
persuaded that King James was acting treacherously.</p>
<p>Besides, the captive himself proved to be so exhausted, that to transport
him any further in his present state would have been almost certainly
fatal.&nbsp; A barber surgeon from Corbeil had been fetched, and was
dealing with the injuries, which had apparently been the effect of a
fall some days previously, probably when on his way to join the French
army at Cosne; and the first fever of these hurts had no doubt been
aggravated by the adventures of the day.&nbsp; At any rate Patrick lay
unconscious, or only from time to time groaning or murmuring a few words,
sometimes French, sometimes Scotch.</p>
<p>Malcolm would have fallen on his knees by his side, and striven to
win a word or a look, but James forcibly withheld him.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you roused him into loud ravings in our own tongue, all hope of saving
him would be gone,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we?&nbsp; Oh, can we?&rsquo; cried Malcolm, catching
at the mere word <i>hope</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only know,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;that unless we do
so by Harry&rsquo;s good-will, I will never serve under him again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if he persists in his cruelty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then must some means be found of carrying Drummond into Corbeil.&nbsp;
It will go hard with me but he shall be saved, Malcolm.&nbsp; But this
whole army is against a Scot; and Harry&rsquo;s eye is everywhere, and
his fierceness unrelenting.&nbsp; Malcolm, this <i>is</i> bondage!&nbsp;
May God and St. Andrew aid us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the King came to saying that, it was plain he deemed the case
past all other aid.</p>
<p>Malcolm&rsquo;s misery was great.&nbsp; The very sight of Patrick
had made a mighty revulsion in his feelings.&nbsp; The almost forgotten
associations of Glenuskie were revived; the forms of his guardian and
of Lily came before him, as he heard familiar names and phrases in the
dear home accent fall from the fevered lips.&nbsp; Coldingham rose up
before him, and St. Abbs, with Lily watching on the rocks for tidings
of her knight&mdash;her knight, to whom her brother had once promised
to resign all his lands and honours, but who now lay captured by plunderers,
among whom that brother made one, and in peril of a shameful death.&nbsp;
Oh, far better die in his stead, than return to Lily with tidings such
as these!</p>
<p>Was this retribution for his broken purpose, and for having fallen
away, not merely into secular life, but into sins that stood between
him and religious rites?&nbsp; The King had called St. Andrew to aid!&nbsp;
Must a proof of repentance and change be given, ere that aid would come?&nbsp;
Should he vow himself again to the cloister, yield up the hope of Esclairmonde,
and devote himself for Patrick&rsquo;s sake?&nbsp; Could he ever be
happy with Patrick dead, and Esclairmonde driven and harassed into being
his wife?&nbsp; Were it not better to vow at once, that so his cousin
were spared he would return to his old purposes?</p>
<p>Almost had he uttered the vow, when, tugging hard at his heart, came
the vision of Esclairmonde&rsquo;s loveliness, and he felt it beyond
his strength to resign her voluntarily; besides, how Madame of Hainault
and Monseigneur de Th&eacute;rouenne would deride his uncertainties;
and how intolerable it would be to leave Esclairmonde to fall into the
hands of Bo&euml;mond of Burgundy.</p>
<p>Such a renunciation could not be made; he did not even know that
Patrick&rsquo;s safety depended on it; and instead of that, he promised,
with great fervency of devotion, that if St. Andrew would save Patrick
Drummond, and bring about the two marriages, a most splendid monastery
for educational purposes, such as the King so much wished to found,
should be his reward.&nbsp; It should be in honour of St. Andrew, and
should be endowed with Esclairmonde&rsquo;s wealth, which would be quite
ample enough, both for this and for a noble portion for Lily.&nbsp;
Surely St. Andrew must accept such a vow, and spare Patrick!&nbsp; So
Malcolm tried to pacify an anguish of suspense that would not be pacified.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII: THE LAST PILGRIMAGE</h2>
<p>The summer morning came; the <i>r&eacute;veille</i> sounded, Mass
was sung in the chapel tent, without which Henry never moved; and Malcolm
tried to reassure his sinking heart by there pledging his vow to St.
Andrew.</p>
<p>The English king was not present; but the troops were drawing up
in complete array, that he might inspect them before the march.&nbsp;
And a glorious array they were, of steel-clad men-at-arms on horseback,
in bands around their leader&rsquo;s banner, and of ranks of sturdy
archers, with their long-bows in leathern cases; the orderly multitude,
stretching as far as the eye could reach, glittering in the early sun,
and waiting with bold and glad hearts to greet the much-loved king,
who had always led them to victory.</p>
<p>The only unarmed knight was James of Scotland.&nbsp; He stood in
the space beside the standard of England, in his plain suit of chamois
leather, his crimson cloak over his shoulder, but with no weapon about
him, waiting with crossed arms for the morning&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Close outside the royal tent waited Henry&rsquo;s horse, and those
of his brother and other immediate attendants; and after a short interval
the King came forth in his brightest armour, with the coronal on his
helmet, and the beaver up; and as he mounted, not without considerable
aid, enthusiastic shouts of &lsquo;Long live King Harry!&rsquo; broke
forth, and came echoing back and back from troop to troop, gathering
fervour as they rose.</p>
<p>The King rode forward towards the standard; but while yet the shouts
were pealing from the army, be suddenly caught at his saddle-bow, reeled
visibly, and would have fallen before Bedford could bring his horse
to his side, had not James sprung forward, and laid one arm round him,
and a hand on his rein.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ere the words were finished, he put his hand to his side, dropped
his bridle, and gasped, while a look of intense suffering passed over
his features; and he was passive while his horse was led back to the
tent, and he was lifted down and placed on the couch he had just quitted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Loose my belt,&rsquo; he gasped; then trying to smile, &lsquo;Percy
has strained it three holes tighter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alas! though it was indeed thus drawn in, his armour was hanging
on him like the shell of a last year&rsquo;s nut.&nbsp; They released
him from it, and he lay against the cushions with short painful respiration,
and frequent cough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must go on with the men at once, John,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will but be blooded, and follow in the litter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Warwick and Salisbury&mdash;&rsquo; began Bedford.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; peremptorily gasped Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
must be you or I, I would, but this stitch in the side catches me, so
that I can neither ride nor speak.&nbsp; Go, instantly.&nbsp; You know
what I have ordered.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be up with you ere the battle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He brooked no resistance.&nbsp; His impatience, and with it the oppression
and pain, only grew by remonstrance; and Bedford was forced to obey
the command to go himself, and leave no one he could help behind him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will stay, at least,&rsquo; said John, in his distress,
turning to the Scottish king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You hold not your wrath?&rsquo; said Bedford.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
will madden me to leave him to any save you in this stress.&nbsp; Some
are dull; some he will not heed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tend him like yourself, John,&rsquo; said the Scot,
taking his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do what he may, Harry is Harry still.&nbsp;
Hasten to your command, John; he will be calmer when you are gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bedford groaned.&nbsp; It was hard to leave his brother at a moment
when he must be more than himself&mdash;become general of an army, with
a battle imminent; but he was under dire necessity, and forced himself
to listen to and gather the import of the few terse orders and directions
that Henry, breathless as he was, rendered clear and trenchant as ever.</p>
<p>The King almost drove his brother away at last, while a barber was
taking a copious stream of blood from him; and as the army had already
been set in motion, a great stillness soon prevailed, no one being left
save a small escort, and part of the King&rsquo;s own immediate household,
for Henry had himself ordered away Montagu, his chamberlain, Percy,
and almost all on whom his eyes fell.&nbsp; The bleeding relieved him;
he breathed less tightly, but became deadly pale, and sank into a doze
of extreme exhaustion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is here?&rsquo; he said, awakening.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some
drink!&nbsp; What you, Jamie!&nbsp; You that were on fire to see a stricken
field!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so much as to see you better at ease,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am better,&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could move
now; and I must.&nbsp; This tent will stifle me by noon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not go forward?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I&rsquo;ll go back.&nbsp; A sick man is best with his
wife.&nbsp; And I can battle it no further, nor grudge the glory of
the day to John.&nbsp; He deserves it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The irascible sharpness had passed from his voice and manner, and
given place to a certain languid cheerfulness, as arrangements were
made for his return to Vincennes.</p>
<p>There proved to be a large and commodious barge, in which the transit
could be effected on the river, with less of discomfort than in the
springless horse litter by which he had travelled the day before; and
this was at once prepared.</p>
<p>Malcolm had meanwhile remained, as in duty bound, in attendance on
his king.&nbsp; James had found time to enjoin him to stay, being, to
say the truth, unwilling to trust one so inexperienced and fragile in
the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> without himself; nor indeed would this
have been a becoming moment for him to put himself forward to win his
spurs in the English cause.</p>
<p>Nothing had passed about Patrick Drummond, nor the high words of
last night.&nbsp; Henry seemed to have forgotten them, between his bodily
suffering and the anxiety of being forced to relinquish the command
just before a battle; and James would have felt it ungenerous to harass
him at such a moment, when absolutely committed to his charge.&nbsp;
For the present, there was no fear of the prisoner being summarily executed
by any lawful authority, since the King had promised to take cognizance
of the case; and the chief danger was from his chance discovery by some
lawless man-at-arms, who would think himself doing good service by killing
a concealed Scot under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Drummond himself, after his delirious night, had sunk into a heavy
sleep; and the King thought the best hope for him would be to remain
under the care of Sir Nigel Baird for the present, until he could obtain
favour for him from Henry, and could send back orders from Vincennes.&nbsp;
He would not leave Malcolm to share the care of him, declaring that
the canny Sir Nigel would have quite enough to do in averting suspicion
without him; and, besides, he needed Malcolm himself, in the scarcity
of attendants who had any tenderness or dexterity of hand to wait upon
the suffering King.</p>
<p>Henry had rallied enough to walk down to the river, leaning upon
James; and he smiled thanks when he was assisted by Trenton and Kitson
to lie along on cushions.&nbsp; &lsquo;So, my Yorkshire knights,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis you that have had to stop from the battle
to watch a sick man home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, Sir,&rsquo; said Sir Christopher; &lsquo;I did it with
the better will, that Trenton here has not been his own man since the
fever; and &lsquo;twere no fair play in the matter your Grace wets of,
did I go into battle whole and sound, and he sick and sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s look of amusement brightened him into his old self,
as he said, &lsquo;Honester guards could I scarce have, good friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, after a nudge or two from Trenton, Kitson and he
came suddenly down on their knees, with an impetus that must have tried
the boards of the bottom of the barge.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said
Kitson, always the spokesman, &lsquo;we have a grace to ask of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say on,&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any boon, save the
letting you cut one another&rsquo;s throats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Sir.&nbsp; Will Trenton&rsquo;s scarce my match now, more&rsquo;s
the pity; and, moreover, we&rsquo;ve lost the good will to it we once
had.&nbsp; No, Sir; &rsquo;twas license to go a pilgrimage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On pilgrimage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, Sir; to yon shrine at Breuil&mdash;St. Fiacre&rsquo;s,
as they call him.&nbsp; Some of our rogues pillaged his shrine, as you
know, Sir; and those that know these parts best, say he was a Scottish
hermit, and bears malice like a Scot, saint though he be; and that your
sickness, my lord, is all along of that.&nbsp; So we two have vowed
to go barefoot there for your healing, my liege, if so be we have your
license.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And welcome, with my best thanks, good friends,&rsquo; said
Henry, exerting himself to lean forward and give his hand to their kiss.&nbsp;
Then, as they fell back into their places, with a few inarticulate blessings
and assurances that they only wished they could go to Rome, or to Jerusalem,
if it would restore their king, Henry said, smiling, as he looked at
James, &lsquo;Scotsmen here, there, and everywhere&mdash;in Heaven as
well as earth!&nbsp; What was it last night about a Scot that moved
thine ire, Jamie?&nbsp; Didst not tender me thy sword?&nbsp; By my faith,
thou hast it not!&nbsp; What was the rub?&rsquo;</p>
<p>James now told the story in its fulness.&nbsp; How he had met Sir
Patrick Drummond at Glenuskie; how, afterwards, the knight had stood
by him in the encounter at Meaux; and how it had been impossible to
leave him senseless to the flames; and how he had trusted that a capture
made thus, accidentally, of a helpless man, would not fall under Henry&rsquo;s
strict rules against accepting Scottish prisoners.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hm!&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;it must be as you will; only
I trust to you not to let him loose on us, either here or on the Border.&nbsp;
Take back your sword, Jamie.&nbsp; If I spoke over hotly last night&mdash;a
man hardly knows what he says when he has a goad in the side&mdash;you
forgive it, Jamie.&rsquo; And as the Scots king, with the dew in his
eyes, wrung his hand, he added anxiously, &lsquo;Your sword!&nbsp; What,
not here!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s mine.&nbsp; Which is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then,
as James handed it to him: &lsquo;Ay, I would fain you wore it!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the sword of my knighthood, when poor King Richard dubbed
me in Ireland; and many a brave scheme came with it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The soft movement of the barge upon the water had a soothing influence;
and he was certainly in a less suffering state, though silent and dreamy,
as he lay half raised on cushions under an awning, James anxiously watching
over him, and Malcolm with a few other attendants near at hand; stout
bargemen propelling the craft, and the guard keeping along the bank
of the river.</p>
<p>His thoughts were perhaps with the battle, for presently he looked
up, and murmured the verse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I had a dream, a weary dream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayont the Isle of Skye;<br />
I saw a dead man win a fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that man was I.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That stave keeps ringing in my brain; nor can I tell where or when
I have heard it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis from the Scottish ballad that sings of the fight
of Otterburn,&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;I brought it with me from Scotland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And got little thanks for your pains,&rsquo; said Henry, smiling.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But, methinks, since no Percy is in the way, I would hear it
again; there was true knighthood in the Douglas that died there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s harp was never far off; and again his mellow voice
went through that gallant and plaintive strain, though in a far more
subdued manner than the first time he had sung it; and Henry, weakened
and softened, actually dropped a brave man&rsquo;s tear at the &lsquo;bracken
bush upon the lily lea,&rsquo; and the hero who lay there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I should weep for a Douglas!&rsquo; he said, half laughing;
&lsquo;but the hearts of all honest men lie near together, on whatever
side they draw their swords.&nbsp; God have mercy on whosoever may fall
to-morrow!&nbsp; I trow, Jamie, thou couldst not sing that rough rhyme
of Agincourt.&nbsp; I was bashful and ungracious enough to loathe the
very sound of it when I came home in my pride of youth; but I would
lief hear it once more.&nbsp; Or, stay&mdash;Yorkshiremen always have
voices;&rsquo; and raising his tone, he unspeakably gratified Trenton
and Kitson by the request; and their voices, deep and powerful, and
not uncultivated, poured forth the Lay of Agincourt to the waves of
the French river, and to its mighty victor:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Our King went forth to Normandye.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long and lengthily chanted was the triumphant song, with the Latin
choruses, which were echoed back by the escort on the bank; while Henry
lay, listening and musing; and Malcolm had time for many a thought and
impulse.</p>
<p>Patrick&rsquo;s life was granted; although it had been promised too
late to send the intelligence back to the tent at Corbeil.&nbsp; So
far, the purpose of his vow to St. Andrew had been accomplished; but
with the probability that he should soon again be associated with Patrick,
came the sense of the failure in purpose and in promise.&nbsp; Patrick
would not reproach him, he well knew&mdash;nay, would rejoice in the
change; but even this certainty galled him, and made him dread his cousin&rsquo;s
presence as likely to bring him a sense of shame.&nbsp; What would Patrick
think of his letting a lady be absolutely compelled to marry him?&nbsp;
Might he not say it was the part of Walter Stewart over again?&nbsp;
Indeed, Malcolm remembered how carefully King James was prevented from
hearing the means by which the Countess intended to make the lady his
own; and a sensation came over him, that it was profanation to call
on St. Andrew to bless what was to be brought about by such means.&nbsp;
Why was it that, as his eyes fell on the face of King Henry, the whole
world and all his projects acquired so different a colouring? and a
sentence he had once heard Esclairmonde quote would come to him constantly:
&lsquo;My son, think not to buy off God.&nbsp; It is thyself that He
requires, not thy gifts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the long lay of victory was over; and King Henry had roused himself
to thank the singers, then sighed, and said, &lsquo;How long ago that
was!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Six years,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The whole space from the hope and pride of youth to the care
and toil of eld,&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your Scots made an
old man of me the day they slew Thomas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet that has been your sole mishap,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, truly!&nbsp; But thenceforth I have learnt that the road
to Jerusalem is not so straight and plain as I deemed it when I stood
victorious at Agincourt.&nbsp; The Church one again&mdash;the Holy Sepulchre
redeemed!&nbsp; It seemed then before my eyes, and that I was the man
called to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it may be yet,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sickness
alters everything, and raises mountains before us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be so,&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;and yet&mdash;Jerusalem!&nbsp;
Jerusalem!&nbsp; It was my father&rsquo;s cry; it was King Edward&rsquo;s
cry; it was St. Louis&rsquo; cry; and yet they never got there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;St. Louis was far on his way,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! he never turned aside!&rsquo; said Henry, sighing, and
moving restlessly and wearily with something of returning fever.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O bona patria, lumina sobria te speculantur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boy, are you there?&rsquo; as, in turning, his eye fell on Malcolm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take warning: the straight road is the best.&nbsp; You see, I
have never come to Jerusalem.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then again he murmured:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hic breve vivitur, hic breve plangitur,
hic breve fletur;<br />
Non breve vivere, non breve plangere, retribuetur.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And James, seeing that nothing lulled him like song, offered to sing
that mysteriously beautiful rhythm of Bernard of Morlaix.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, prithee do so,&rsquo; said Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
a rest there, when the Agincourt lay rings hollow.&nbsp; Well, there
is a Jerusalem where our shortcomings are made up; only the straight
way&mdash;the straight way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm took his part with James in singing the rhythm, which he
had learnt long ago at Coldingham, and which thus in every note brought
back the vanished aspirations and self-dedication to &lsquo;the straight
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For such, an original purpose of self-devotion must ever be&mdash;not
of course exclusively to the monastic life; but whoever lowers his aims
of serving God under any worldly inducement, is deviating from the straight
way: and, thought Malcolm, if King Harry feels Agincourt an empty word
beside the song of Sion, must not all I have sought for be a very vanity?</p>
<p>Sometimes dozing, but sometimes restless, and with the pain of breathing
constantly increasing on him, Henry wore through the greater part of
the day, upon the river, until it was necessary to land, and be taken
through the forest in his litter.&nbsp; He was now obliged to be lifted
from the barge; and his weariness rendered the conveyance very distressing,
save that his patient smile never faded; and still he said, &lsquo;All
will be well when I come to my Kate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alas! when the gates were reached, James hardly knew how to tell
him that the Queen had gone that morning to Paris with her mother.&nbsp;
Yet still he was cheerful.&nbsp; &lsquo;If the physicians deal hard
with me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it will be well that she should not
be here till the worst is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The physicians were there.&nbsp; A messenger had gone direct from
Corbeil to summon them; and Henry delivered himself up into their hands,
to fight out the battle with disease, as he had set himself to fight
out many another battle in his time.</p>
<p>A sharp conflict it was&mdash;between a keen and aggravated disease,
apparently pleurisy coming upon pulmonary affection of long standing,
and a strong and resolute nature, unquenched by suffering, and backed
by the violent remedies of a half-instructed period.&nbsp; Those who
watched him, and strove to fulfil the directions of the physicians,
hardly marked the lapse of hours; even though more than one day and
night had passed ere in the early twilight of a long summer&rsquo;s
morn he sank into a sleep, his face still distressed, but less acutely,
and his breath heavy and labouring, though without the severe pain.</p>
<p>The watchers felt that here might be the turning point, and stood
or sat around, not daring to change their postures, or utter the slightest
word.&nbsp; Suddenly, James, who stood nearest, leaning against the
wall, with his eyes fixed on the face of the sleeper, was aware of a
hand on his shoulder, and looking round, saw in the now full light Bedford&rsquo;s
face&mdash;so pale, haggard, and replete with anxiety, so dusty and
travel-stained, that Henry, awakening at that moment, exclaimed, &lsquo;Ha,
John!&rsquo;&nbsp; And as his brother was slow to reply&mdash;&lsquo;Has
the day gone against thee?&nbsp; How was it?&nbsp; Never fear to speak,
brother; thou art safe; and I know thou hast done valiantly.&nbsp; Valour
is never lost, whether in defeat or success.&nbsp; Speak, John.&nbsp;
Take it not so much to heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There has been no battle, Harry,&rsquo; said Bedford, gathering
voice with difficulty.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Dauphin would not abide our
coming, but broke up his camp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beshrew thee, man!&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;but I thought
thou wast just off a flight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dost think one can ride fast only for a flight?&rsquo; said
Bedford.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, would that it had been the loss of ten battles
rather than this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he fell on his knees, grasping Henry&rsquo;s hand, and hiding
his face against the bed, with the same instinct of turning to him for
comfort with which the young motherless children of Henry of Bolingbroke,
when turned adrift among the rude Beaufort progeny of John of Gaunt,
had clung to their eldest brother, and found tenderness in his love
and protection in his fearlessness; so that few royal brethren ever
loved better than Henry and John of Lancaster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was well and kindly done, John,&rsquo; said Henry; &lsquo;and
thou hast come at a good time; for, thanks be to God, the pain hath
left me; and if it were not for this burthen of heaviness and weariness,
I should be more at ease than I have been for many weeks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But as he spoke, there was that both in his face and voice that chilled
with a dread certainty the hearts of those who hung over him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is my wife come?&nbsp; I could see her now,&rsquo; he wistfully
asked.</p>
<p>Alas! no.&nbsp; Sir Lewis Robsart, the knight attached to her service,
faltered, with a certain shame and difficulty, that the Queen would
come when her orisons at Notre Dame were performed.</p>
<p>It was his last disappointment; but still he bore it cheerily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Best,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;My fair one was not made
for sights like this; and were she here&rsquo;&mdash;his lip trembled&mdash;&lsquo;I
might bear me less as a Christian man should.&nbsp; My sweet Catherine!&nbsp;
Take care of her, John; she will be the most desolate being in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John promised with all his heart; though pity for cold-hearted Catherine
was not the predominant feeling there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would I had seen my child&rsquo;s face, and blessed him,&rsquo;
continued Henry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor boy!&nbsp; I would have him Warwick&rsquo;s
charge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Warwick is waiting admission,&rsquo; said Bedford.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
and Salisbury and Exeter rode with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s face lighted up with joy as he heard this.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is good for a man to have his friends about him,&rsquo; he
said; and as they entered he held out his hand to them and thanked them.</p>
<p>Then took place the well-known scene, when, looking back on his career,
he pronounced it to have been his endeavour to serve God and his people,
and declared himself ready to face death fearlessly, since such was
the will of his Maker: grieving only for the infancy of his son, but
placing his hope and comfort in his brother John, and commending the
babe to the fatherly charge of Warwick.&nbsp; &lsquo;You cannot love
him for his own sake as yet; but if you think you owe me aught, repay
it to him.&rsquo;&nbsp; And as he thought over the fate of other infant
kings, he spoke of some having hated the father and loved the child,
others who had loved the father and hated the child.</p>
<p>To Humfrey of Gloucester he sent stringent warnings against giving
way to his hot and fiery nature, offending Burgundy, or rushing into
a doubtful wedlock with Jaqueline of Hainault; speaking of him with
an elder brother&rsquo;s fatherly affection, but turning ever to John
of Bedford with full trust and reliance, as one like-minded, and able
to carry out all his intentions.&nbsp; For the French prisoners, they
might not be released, &lsquo;lest more fire be kindled in one day than
can be quenched in three.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And for you, Jamie,&rsquo; he said, affectionately holding
out his hand, &lsquo;my friend, my brother-in-arms, I must say the same
as ever.&nbsp; Pardon me, Jamie; but I have not kept you out of malice,
such as man must needs renounce on his death-bed.&nbsp; I trust to John,
and to the rest, for giving you freedom at such time as you can safely
return to be such a king indeed as we have ever hoped to be.&nbsp; Do
you pardon me, James, for this, as for any harshness or rudeness you
may have suffered from me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>James, with full heart, murmured out his ardent love, his sense that
no captive had ever been so generously treated as he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, my young lord,&rsquo; said Henry, looking towards
Malcolm, whose light touch and tender hands had made him a welcome attendant
in the illness, &lsquo;I have many a kind service to thank you for.&nbsp;
And I believe I mightily angered you once; but, boy, remember&mdash;ay,
and you too, Ralf Percy&mdash;that he is your friend who turns you back
from things sore to remember in a case like mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After these, and other calm collected farewells, Henry required to
know from his physicians how long his time might yet be.&nbsp; There
was hesitation in answering, plainly as they saw that mortification
had set in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;do ye think I have faced death
so many times to fear it now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then came the reply given by the weeping, kneeling physician: &lsquo;Sir,
think of your soul, for, without a miracle, you cannot live two hours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King beckoned his confessor, and his friends retired, to return
again to take their part in the last rites, the Viaticum and Unction.</p>
<p>Henry was collected, and alive to all that was passing, responding
duly, and evidently entering deeply into the devotions that were to
aid his spirit in that awful passage; his face gravely set, but firm
and fearless as ever.&nbsp; The ceremonial ended, he was still sensible,
though with little power of voice or motion left; but the tone, though
low, was steady as ever, when he asked for the Penitential Psalms.&nbsp;
Still they doubted whether he were following them, for his eyes closed,
and his lips ceased to move, until, as they chanted the revival note
of David&rsquo;s mournful penance&mdash;&lsquo;O be favourable and gracious
unto Sion; build Thou the walls of Jerusalem;&rsquo;&mdash;at that much-loved
word, the light of the blue eyes once more beamed out, and he spoke
again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jerusalem!&nbsp; On the faith of a dying king, it
was my earnest purpose to have composed matters here into peace and
union, and so to have delivered Jerusalem.&nbsp; But the will of God
be done, since He saw me unworthy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then his eyes closed again; he slept, or seemed to sleep; and then
a strange quivering came over the face, the lips moved again, and the
words broke from them, &lsquo;Thou liest, foul spirit! thou liest!&rsquo;
but, as though the parting soul had gained the victory in that conflict,
peace came down on the wasted features; and with the very words of his
Redeemer Himself, &lsquo;Into Thy hands I commend my spirit,&rsquo;
he did indeed fall asleep; the mighty soul passed from the worn-out
frame.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII: THE RING AND THE EMPTY THRONE</h2>
<p>No one knows how great a tree has been till it has fallen; nor how
large a space a mighty man has occupied till he is removed.</p>
<p>King Henry V. left his friends and foes alike almost dizzy, as in
place of his grand figure they found a blank; instead of the hand whose
force they had constantly felt, mere emptiness.</p>
<p>Malcolm of Glenuskie, who had been asserting constantly that King
Henry was no master of his, and had no rights over him, had nevertheless,
for the last year or more, been among those to whom the King&rsquo;s
will was the moving spring, fixing the disposal of almost every hour,
and making everything dependent thereon.</p>
<p>When the death-hush was broken by the &lsquo;Depart, O Christian
soul,&rsquo; and Bedford, with a face white and set like a statue, stood
up from his knees, and crossed and kissed the still white brow, it was
to Malcolm as if the whole universe had become as nothing.&nbsp; To
him there remained only the great God, the heavenly Jerusalem into which
the King had entered, and himself far off from the straight way, wandering
from his promise and his purpose into what seemed to him a mere hollow
painted scene, such as came and went in the midst of a banquet.&nbsp;
Or, again, it was the grisly Dance of Death that was the only reality;
Death had clutched the mightiest in the ring.&nbsp; Whom would he clutch
next?</p>
<p>He stood motionless, as one in a dream, or rather as if not knowing
which was reality, and which phantom; gazing, gazing on at the bed where
the King lay, round which the ecclesiastics were busying themselves,
unperceiving that James, Bedford, and the nobles had quitted the apartment,
till Percy first spoke to him in a whisper, then almost shook him, and
led him out of the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sent for you,&rsquo; he said,
in a much shaken voice; &lsquo;your king says you can be of use.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then tightening his grasp with the force of intense grief, &lsquo;Oh,
what a day! what a day!&nbsp; My father! my father!&nbsp; I never knew
mine own father!&nbsp; But he has been all to Harry and to me!&nbsp;
Oh, woe worth the day!&rsquo;&nbsp; And dropping into a window-seat,
he covered his face with his hands, and gave way to his grief: pointing,
however, to the council-room, where Malcolm found Bedford writing at
the table, King James, and a few others, engaged in the same manner.</p>
<p>A few words from James informed him (or would have done so if he
could have understood) that the Duke of Bedford, on whom at that terrible
moment the weight of two kingdoms and of the war had descended, could
not pause to rest, or to grieve, till letters and orders had been sent
to the council in England, and to every garrison, every ally in France,
to guard against any sudden panic, or faltering in friendship to England
and her infant heir.&nbsp; Warwick and Salisbury were already riding
post haste to take charge of the army; Robsart was gone to the Queen,
Exeter to the Duke of Burgundy; and as the clergy were all engaged with
the tendance of the royal corpse, there was scarcely any one to lessen
the Duke&rsquo;s toil.&nbsp; James, knowing Malcolm&rsquo;s pen to be
ready, had sent for him to assist in copying the brief scrolls, addressed
to each captain of a fortress or town, announcing the father&rsquo;s
death, and commanding him to do his duty to the son&mdash;King Harry
VI.&nbsp; Each was then to be signed by the Duke, and despatched by
men-at-arms, who waited for the purpose.</p>
<p>Like men stunned, the half-dozen who sat at the council-table worked
on, never daring to glance at the empty chair at the upper end.&nbsp;
The only words that passed were occasional inquiries of, and orders
from, Bedford; and these he spoke with a strange alertness and metallic
ring in his voice, as though the words were uttered by mechanism; yet
in themselves they were as clear and judicious as possible, as if coming
from a mind wound up exclusively to the one necessary object; and the
face&mdash;though flushed at first, and gradually growing paler, with
knitted brows and compressed lips&mdash;betrayed no sign of emotion.</p>
<p>Hours passed: he wrote, he ordered, he signed, he sealed; he mentioned
name after name, of place and officer, never moving or looking up.&nbsp;
And James, who knew from Salisbury that he had neither slept nor eaten
since sixty miles off he had met a worse report of his brother, watched
him anxiously till, when evening began to fall, he murmured, &lsquo;There
is the captain of&mdash;of&mdash;at&mdash;but&mdash;&rsquo;&mdash;the
pen slipped from his fingers, and he said, &lsquo;I can no more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The overtaxed powers, strained so long&mdash;mind, memory, and all&mdash;were
giving way under the mere force of excessive fatigue.&nbsp; He rose
from his seat, but stumbled, like one blind, as James upheld him, and
led him away to the nearest bed-chamber, where, almost while the attendants
divested him of the heavy boots and cuirass he had never paused all
these hours to remove, he dropped into a sleep of sheer exhaustion.</p>
<p>James, who was likewise wearied out with watching, turned towards
his own quarters; but, in so doing, he could not but turn aside to the
chapel, where before the altar had been laid all that was left of King
Henry.&nbsp; There he lay, his hands clasped over a crucifix, clad in
the same rich green and crimson robes in which he had ridden to meet
his Queen at Vincennes but three short months before; the golden circlet
from his helmet was on his head, but it could not give additional majesty
to the still and severe sweetness of his grand and pure countenance,
so youthful in the lofty power that high aspirations had imprinted on
it, yet so intensely calm in its marble rest, more than ever with the
look of the avenging unpitying angel.&nbsp; To James, it was chiefly
the face of the man whom he had best loved and admired, in spite of
their strange connection; but to Malcolm, who had as usual followed
him closely, it was verily a look from the invisible world&mdash;a look
of awful warning and reproof, almost as if the pale set lips were unclosing
to demand of him where he was in the valley of shadows, through which
the way lay to Jerusalem.&nbsp; If Henry had turned back, and warned
him at the gate of the heavenly Sion, surely such would have been his
countenance; and Malcolm, when, like James, he had sprinkled the holy
water on the white brow, and crossed himself while the low chant of
Psalms from kneeling priests went up around him&mdash;clasped his two
hands close together, and breathed forth the words, &lsquo;Oh, I have
wandered far!&nbsp; O great King, I will never leave the straight way
again!&nbsp; I will cast aside all worldly aims!&nbsp; O God, and the
Saints, help me not to lose my way again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He would have tarried on still, in the fascination of that wonderful
unearthly countenance, and in the inertness of faculties stunned by
fatigue and excitement, but James summoned him by a touch, and he again
followed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Sir!&rsquo; he began, when they had turned away, &lsquo;I
repent me of my falling away to the world!&nbsp; I give all up.&nbsp;
Let me back to my vows of old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will talk of that another time,&rsquo; said James, gravely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Neither you nor I, Malcolm, can think reasonably under such a
blow as this; and I forbid you rashly to bind yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, Sir!&rsquo; cried Malcolm, petulantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
took me from the straight way.&nbsp; You shall not hinder my return!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hinder no true purpose,&rsquo; said King James.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
only hinder another rash and hasty pledge, to be felt as a fetter, or
left broken on your conscience.&nbsp; Silence now.&nbsp; When men are
sad and spent they cannot speak as befits them, and had best hold their
peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These words were spoken on the way up the stair that led to the apartments
of the King of Scots.&nbsp; On opening the door of the larger room,
the first thing they saw was the tall figure of a distinguished-looking
knight, who, as they entered, flung himself at King James&rsquo;s feet,
fervently exclaiming, &lsquo;O my liege! accept my homage!&nbsp; Never
was vassal so bound to his lord by thankfulness for his life, and for
far more than his life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir Patrick Drummond, I am glad to see you better at ease,&rsquo;
said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, suffer me,&rsquo; he added, giving his
hand to raise the knight, but finding it grasped and kissed with passionate
devotion, almost overpowering the only half-recovered knight, so that
James was forced to use strength to support him, and would at once have
lifted him up, but the warm-hearted Patrick resisted, almost sobbing
out&mdash;&lsquo;Nay, Sir! king of my heart indeed! let me first thank
you.&nbsp; I knew not how much more I owed you than the poor life you
saved&mdash;my father&rsquo;s rescue, and that of all that was most
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak of such things seated, my good friend,&rsquo; said James,
trying to raise him; but Drummond still did not second his efforts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not given my parole of honour as the captive whose
life is again due to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must give that to the Duke of Bedford, Sir Patrick,&rsquo;
said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know not if I am to be put into ward myself.&nbsp;
In any case you are safe, by the good King&rsquo;s grace, so you pledge
yourself to draw no sword against England in Scotland or France till
ransom be accepted for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alack!&rsquo; said Patrick, &lsquo;I have neither sword nor
ransom.&nbsp; I would I knew what was to be done with the life you have
given me, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will find a use for it, never fear,&rsquo; said James, sadly,
but kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be my knight for the present, till better days
come for us both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With my whole heart!&rsquo; said Patrick, fervently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yours am I for ever, my liege.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then my first command is that you should rise, and rest,&rsquo;
said James, assisting the knight to regain his feet, and placing him
in the only chair in the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must become a whole
man as soon as may be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For Patrick&rsquo;s arm was in a sling, and evidently still painful
and useless, and he sank back, breathless and unresisting, like one
who had by no means regained perfect health, while his handsome features
looked worn and pale.&nbsp; &lsquo;I fear me,&rsquo; said James, as
the two cousins silently shook hands, &lsquo;that you have moved over
soon.&mdash;You surely had my message, Bairdsbrae?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, my lord,&rsquo; replied Baird; &lsquo;but the lad
was the harder to hold; and after the fever was gone, we deemed he could
well brook the journey by water.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas time I was here to
guide ye too, my lord; you and the callant baith look sair forfaughten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have had a sad time of it, Nigel,&rsquo; said James, with
trembling lip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if Brewster tells me right, ye&rsquo;ve not tasted food
the whole day?&rsquo; said Nigel, laying an authoritative hand on his
royal pupil.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, sit ye down; here come the varlets with
the meal I bade them have ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James passively yielded, courteously signing to the others to share
the food that was spread on a table; and with the same scarcely conscious
grace, making inquiries, which elicited that Patrick Drummond&rsquo;s
hurts had been caused by his horse falling and rolling over with him,
whilst with Sir John Swinton and other Scottish knights he was reconnoitring
the line of the English march.&nbsp; He was too much injured to be taken
back to the far distant camp, and had accordingly been intrusted to
the French farmer, with no attendant but a young French horse-boy, since
he was too poor to keep a squire.&nbsp; He knew nothing more, for fever
had run high; and he had not even been sensible of his desertion by
his French hosts on the approach of the English, far less of the fire,
and of his rescue by the King and Malcolm; but for this he seemed inclined
to compensate to the utmost, by the intense eagerness of devotion with
which he regarded James, who sat meanwhile crushed down by the weight
of his own grief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can eat no more, Baird,&rsquo; said he, swallowing down
a draught of wine, and pushing aside his trencher.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
license, gentlemen.&nbsp; I must be alone.&nbsp; Take care of the lads,
Nigel.&nbsp; Malcolm is spent too.&nbsp; His deft service was welcome
to&mdash;to my dearest brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And though he hastily shut himself into his own inner chamber, it
was not till they had seen that his grief was becoming uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Patrick could not but murmur, &lsquo;Dearest brother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, like brothers they loved!&rsquo; said Baird, gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A strange brotherhood,&rsquo; began Drummond.</p>
<p>But Malcolm cried, with much agitation, &lsquo;Not a word, Patie!&nbsp;
You know not what you say.&nbsp; Take heed of profaning the name of
one who is gone to the Sion above.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You turned English, our wee Malcolm!&rsquo; exclaimed Drummond,
in amaze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no English, French, or Scot where he is gone!&rsquo;
cried Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;No Babel!&nbsp; O Patie, I have been far
fallen!&nbsp; I have done you in heart a grievous wrong! but if I have
turned back in time, it is his doing that lies there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His! what, Harry of Lancaster&rsquo;s?&rsquo; demanded the
bewildered Patrick.&nbsp; &lsquo;What had he to do with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has been my only true friend here!&rsquo; cried Malcolm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, if my hand be free from actual spoil and bloodshed, it was
his doing!&nbsp; Oh, that he could hear me bless him for the chastisement
I took so bitterly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chastisement!&rsquo; demanded Patrick.&nbsp; &lsquo;The English
King dared chastise <i>you</i>! of Scots blood royal!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
well he is dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The laddie&rsquo;s well-nigh beside himself!&rsquo; said Baird.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But he speaks true.&nbsp; This king whom Heaven assolizie, kept
a tight hand over the youngsters; and falling on Lord Malcolm and some
other callants making free with a house at Meaux, dealt some blows,
of which my young lord found it hard to stomach his share; though I
am glad to see he is come to a better mind.&nbsp; Ay, &rsquo;tis pity
of this King Harry!&nbsp; Brave and leal was he; never spake an untrue
word; never turned eye for fear, nor foot for weariness, nor hand for
toil, nor nose for ill savour.&nbsp; A man, look you, to be trusted;
never failing his word for good or ill!&nbsp; Right little love has
there been between him and me; but I could weep like my own lad in there,
to think I shall never see that knightly presence more, nor hear those
frank gladsome voices of the boys, as they used to shout up and down
Windsor Forest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You too, Sir Nigel! and with a king like ours!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, Sir Patrick! and if he be such a king as Scotland never
had since St. David, and maybe not then, I&rsquo;m free to own as much
of it is due to King Harry as to his own noble self.&mdash;Did ye say
they had streekit him in the chapel, Lord Malcolm?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d fain
look on the bonnie face of him; I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er look on his like
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had old Bairdsbrae gone, than Malcolm flung himself down
before his cousin, crying, &lsquo;Oh, Patrick, you will hear me!&nbsp;
I cannot rest till you know how changed I have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Changed!&rsquo; said Patrick; &lsquo;ay, and for the better!&nbsp;
Why, Malcolm, I never durst hope to see you so sturdy and so heartsome.&nbsp;
My father would have been blithe to see you such a gallant young squire.&nbsp;
Even the halt is gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nearly,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I would fain
be puny and puling, to have the clear heart that once I had.&nbsp; Oh,
hear me! hear me! and pardon me, Patie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Malcolm, in his agitation, poured forth the whole story of his
having shifted from his old cherished purpose of devoting himself to
the service of Heaven, and leaving lands and vassals to the stronger
hands of Patrick and Lilias; how, having thus given himself to the world,
he had fallen into temptation; how he had let himself be led to persecute
with his suit a noble lady, vowed like himself; how he had almost agreed
to marry her by force: and how he had been running into the ordinary
dissipations of the camp, abstaining from confession, avoiding mass;
disobeying orders, plunging into scenes of plunder, till he had almost
been the death of Patrick, whom he had already so cruelly wronged.</p>
<p>So felt the boy.&nbsp; Fresh from that death-bed, the evils his conscience
had protested against from the first appeared to him frightfully heinous,
and his anguish of self-reproach was such, that Patrick listened in
the greatest anxiety lest he should hear of some deadly stain on his
young kinsman&rsquo;s scutcheon; but when the tale was told, and he
had demanded &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; and found that no further overt
act was alleged against Malcolm, he breathed a long sigh, and muttered,
&lsquo;You daft laddie! you had fairly startled me!&nbsp; So this is
the coil, is it?&nbsp; Who ever told you to put on a cowl, I should
like to know?&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;twas what my poor father ever declared
against.&nbsp; I take your lands!&nbsp; By my troth! &lsquo;twould be
enough to make me break faith with your sister, if I <i>could</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The vow was in my heart,&rsquo; faltered Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a fule&rsquo;s head!&rsquo; said Patrick.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
right have babes to be talking of vows?&nbsp; &lsquo;Twould be the best
tidings I&rsquo;ve heard for many a long day, that you were wedded to
a lass with a good tocher, and fit to guide your silly pate.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
that?&nbsp; Her vows!&nbsp; If they are no better than yours, the sooner
they are forgot the better.&nbsp; If she had another love, &lsquo;twould
be another matter, but with a bishop on your side, you&rsquo;ve naught
to fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm turned away, sick at heart.&nbsp; To him his present position
had become absolute terror.&nbsp; His own words had worked him up to
an alarming sense of having lapsed from high aims to mere selfishness;
of having profaned vows, consented to violence, and fallen away from
grace; and he was in an almost feverish passion to utter something that
would irrevocably bind him to his former intentions; but here were the
King and Patrick both conspiring to silence him, and hold him back to
his fallen and perilous state.&nbsp; Nay, Patrick even derided his penitence.&nbsp;
Patrick was an honourable knight, a religious man, as times went, but
he had been brought up in a much rougher and more unscrupulous school
than Malcolm, and had been hardened by years of service as a soldier
of fortune.&nbsp; The Armagnac camp was not like that of England.&nbsp;
Warriors of such piety and strictness as Henry and Bedford had never
come within his ken; and that any man, professing to be a soldier, should
hesitate at the license of war, was incomprehensible to him.&nbsp; The
discipline of Henry&rsquo;s army had been scoffed at in the French camp,
and every infraction of it hailed as a token of hypocrisy; and to the
stout Scot Malcolm&rsquo;s grief for the rapine at Meaux, which after
all he had not committed, seemed a simple absurdity.&nbsp; Even his
own danger, on the second occasion, did not make him alter his opinion;
it was all the fortune of war.&nbsp; And he was not sure that he had
not best have been stifled at once, since his hands were tied from warfare.&nbsp;
And as for Lily&mdash;how was he to win her now?&nbsp; Then, as Malcolm
opened his mouth, Patrick sharply charged him to hold his tongue as
to that folly, unless he wanted to drive him to make a vow on his side,
that he would turn Knight of Rhodes, and never wed.</p>
<p>Malcolm, wearied out with excitement, came at last to weeping that
no one would hear or understand him; but the scene was ended by Bairdsbrae,
who, returning, brought a leech with him, who at once took the command
of Patrick, and ordered him to his bed.</p>
<p>Malcolm could not rest.&nbsp; He was feverish with the shock of grief
and awe, and absorbed in the thought which had mastered him, and which
was much dwelt on in the middle ages:&mdash;the monastic path, going
towards heaven straight as a sunbeam; the secular, twining its way through
a tortuous difficult course&mdash;the &lsquo;broad way,&rsquo; tending
downward to the abyss.&nbsp; To his terrified apprehension, he had abandoned
the direct and narrow path for the fatal road, and there might at any
moment be captured, and whirled away by the grisly phantom Death, who
had just snatched the mightiest in his inevitable clutch; and with something
of the timidity of his nature, he was in absolute terror, until he should
be able to set himself back on the shining road from which he had swerved,
and be rid of the load of transgression which seemed ready to sink him
into the gulf.</p>
<p>Those few and perfunctory confessions to a courtly priest who knew
nothing about him, and was sure not to be hard on a king&rsquo;s cousin,
now seemed to add to his guilt: and, wandering down-stairs towards the
chapel, he met a train of ecclesiastics slowly leaving it, having just
been relieved by a bevy of monks from a neighbouring convent, who took
up the chants where they had left them.</p>
<p>Looking up at them, he recognized Dr. Bennet&rsquo;s bent head, and
throwing himself before him on his knee, he gasped, &lsquo;O father,
father! hear me!&nbsp; Take me back!&nbsp; Give me hope!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What means this, my young lord?&rsquo; said Dr. Bennet, pausing,
while his brethren passed on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you sick?&rsquo; he added,
kindly, seeing the whiteness of Malcolm&rsquo;s face, and his startled
eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, no! only sick at heart at my own madness, and the
doom on it!&nbsp; O Sir, hear me!&nbsp; Take my vow again! give me absolution
once more to a true shrift.&nbsp; Oh, if you will hear me, it shall
be honest this time!&nbsp; Only put me in the way again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The chaplain was sorely sad and weary.&nbsp; He it was whose ministrations
had chiefly comforted the dying King.&nbsp; To him it had been the loss
of a deeply-loved son and pupil, as well as of almost unbounded hopes
for the welfare of the Church; and he had had likewise, in the freshness
of his sorrow, to take the lead in the ecclesiastical ceremonies that
ensued, so that both in body and mind he was well-nigh worn out, and
longed for peace in which to face his own private sorrow; but the wild
words and anguished looks of the young Scot showed him that his case
was one for immediate hearing, and he drew the lad into the confessional,
authoritatively calmed his agitation, and prepared to hear the outpouring
of the boy&rsquo;s self-reproach.</p>
<p>He heard it all&mdash;sifting facts from fancies, and learning the
early purpose, the terror at the cruel world, the longing for peace
and shelter; the desire to smooth his sister&rsquo;s way, which had
led him to devote himself in heart to the cloister, though never permitted
openly to pledge himself.&nbsp; Then the discovery that the world was
less thorny than he had expected; the allurement of royal favour and
greatness; the charm of amusement, and activity in recovered health;
the cowardly dread of scorn, leading him not merely into the secular
life, but into the gradual dropping of piety and devotion; the actual
share he had taken in forbidden diversions; his attempts at plunder;
his ill-will to King Henry; and, above all, his persecution of Esclairmonde,
which he now regarded as sacrilegious; and he even told how he lay under
a half engagement to Countess Jaqueline to return alone to the Court,
and bear his part in the forcible marriage she projected.</p>
<p>He told all, with no extenuation; nay, rather with such outbursts
of opprobrium on himself, that Dr. Bennet could hardly understand of
what positive evils he had been guilty; and he ended by entreating that
the almoner would at once hear his vow to become a Benedictine monk,
ere&mdash;</p>
<p>But Dr. Bennet would not listen.&nbsp; He silenced the boy by saying
he had no more right to hear it than Malcolm as yet to make it.&nbsp;
Nay, that inner dedication, for which Malcolm yearned as a sacred bond
to his own will, the priest forbade.&nbsp; It was no moment to make
such a promise in his present mood, when he did not know himself.&nbsp;
If broken, he would only be adding sin to sin; nor was Malcolm, with
all his errors fresh upon him, in any state to dedicate himself worthily.&nbsp;
The errors&mdash;which in Ralf Percy, or in most other youths, might
have seemed slight&mdash;were heavy stains on one who, like Malcolm,
had erred, not thoughtlessly, but with a conscience of them all, in
wilful abandonment of his higher principles.&nbsp; On these the chaplain
mostly dwelt; on these he tried to direct Malcolm&rsquo;s repentance;
and, finding that the youth was in perpetual extremes of remorse, and
that his abject submission was a sort of fresh form of wilfulness, almost
passion at being forbidden to bind himself by the vow, he told him that
the true token of repentance was steadiness and constancy; and that
therefore his absolution must be deferred until he had thus shown that
his penitence was true and sincere&mdash;by perseverance, firstly, in
the devotions that the chaplain appointed for him, and, secondly, in
meeting whatever temptations might be in store for him.&nbsp; Nay, the
cruel chaplain absolutely forbade the white, excited, eager boy to spend
half the night in chapel over the first division of these penitential
psalms and prayers, but on his obedience sent him at once to his bed.</p>
<p>Malcolm could have torn his hair.&nbsp; Unabsolved!&nbsp; Still under
the weight of sin; still unpledged; still on dangerous ground; still
left to a secular life&mdash;and that without Esclairmonde!&nbsp; Why
had he not gone to a French Benedictine, who would have caught at his
vow, and crowned his penitence with some magnificent satisfying asceticism?</p>
<p>Yet something in his heart, something in the father&rsquo;s own authority,
made him submit; and in a tumult of feeling, more wretched even than
before his confession, he threw himself on his bed, expecting to charge
the tossings of a miserable night on Dr. Bennet, and to creep down barefoot
to the chapel in the early morning to begin his <i>Misereres</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of which, his first wakening was in broad daylight, by King
James standing over him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Malcolm,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I
have answered for you that you are discreet and trusty.&nbsp; A message
of weight is to be placed in your hands.&nbsp; Come with me to the Duke
of Bedford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm could only dress himself, and obediently follow to the chamber,
where sat the Duke, his whole countenance looking as if the light of
his life had gone out, but still steadfastly set to bear the heavy burden
that had been placed on his shoulders.</p>
<p>He called Malcolm to him, and showed him a ring, asking whether he
knew it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The King&rsquo;s signet&mdash;King Harry&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said
Malcolm.</p>
<p>He was then reminded how, in the winter, Henry had lost the ring,
and after having caused another to be made at Paris, had found it in
the finger of his gauntlet.&nbsp; Very few knew of the existence of
this duplicate.&nbsp; Bedford himself was not aware of it till it had
been mentioned by James and Lord Fitzhugh the chamberlain; and then
search was made for it, without effect, so that it evidently had been
left with the Queen.&nbsp; These private signets were of the utmost
importance, far more so than even the autograph; for, though signatures
were just acquiring individuality enough to become the best authentication,
yet up to this very reign the seal was the only valid affirmation.&nbsp;
Such signets were always destroyed on a prince&rsquo;s death, and it
was of the utmost importance that the duplicate should not be left in
Queen Catherine&rsquo;s hands&mdash;above all, while she was with her
mother and her party, who were quite capable of affixing it to forgeries.</p>
<p>Bedford, James, and Fitzhugh were all required at Vincennes; the
two latter at the lying-in-state in the chapel.&nbsp; Most of the other
trusty nobles had repaired to the army; and, indeed, Bedford, aware
of the terrible jealousies that were sure to break out in the headless
realm, did not choose to place a charge that might hereafter prove invidious
in the hands of any Englishman, or to extend the secret any further
than could be helped; since who could tell what suspicion might not
be thus cast on any paper sealed by Henry?</p>
<p>In his perplexity, James had suggested young Malcolm, who had assisted
in the search for the lost ring, and been witness to its discovery;
and whom he could easily send as bearer of his condolences to the widowed
Queen; who had indeed the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> of the palace, but had
no political standing, was neither French nor English, and had shown
himself discreet enough with other secrets to deserve confidence.</p>
<p>Bedford caught at the proposal.&nbsp; And Malcolm now received orders
to take horse, with a sufficient escort, and hasten at once to Paris,
where he should try if possible to obtain the ring from the Queen herself;
but if he could not speak to her in private, he might apply to Sir Lewis
Robsart.&nbsp; No other person was to be informed of the real object
of the mission, and he was to get back to Vincennes as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Neither prince could understand the scared, distressed looks with
which Malcolm listened to commands showing so much confidence in a youth
of his years.&nbsp; They encouraged him by assurances that Sir Lewis
Robsart, who had a curious kind of authority, half fatherly, half nurselike,
over the Queen, would manage all for him.&nbsp; And King James, provoked
by his reluctance, began, as they left Bedford&rsquo;s chamber, to chide
him for ungraciousness in the time of distress, and insensibility to
the honour conferred on him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, nay,&rsquo; disclaimed Malcolm, almost ready to weep,
&lsquo;but I have a whole world of penance!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Penance!&nbsp; Plague on the boy&rsquo;s perverseness!&nbsp;
What penance is so good as obedience?&rsquo; said James, much displeased.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, Sir,&rsquo; panted Malcolm, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis not only
that.&nbsp; Could any one but be sent in my stead?&nbsp; My returning
alone is what Madame of Hainault bade&mdash;for&mdash;for some scheme
on&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>His voice was choked, and his face was burning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the lad gone daft?&rsquo; cried James, in great anger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If Madame of Hainault were so lost to decorum as to hatch such
schemes at such a moment, I trow you are neither puppet nor fool in
her hands for her to do what she will with.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have no
more fooling!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm could only obey.</p>
<p>In the brief space while the horses were preparing, and he had to
equip and take food, he sped in search of Dr. Bennet, hoping, he knew
not what, from his interference, or trusting, at any rate, to explain
his own sudden absence.</p>
<p>But, looking into the chapel, he recognized the chaplain as one of
the leading priests in one of the lengthiest of masses, which was just
commencing.&nbsp; It was impossible to wait for the conclusion.&nbsp;
He could but kneel down, find himself too much hurried and confused
to recollect any prayer, then dash back again to don his riding-gear,
before King James should miss him, and be angered again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unabsolved&mdash;unvowed!&rsquo; he thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sent
off thither against my will.&nbsp; Whatever may fall out, it is no fault
of mine!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV: THE TROTH FLIGHT</h2>
<p>Trembling and awed, the ladies waited at Paris.&nbsp; It was well
known how the King&rsquo;s illness must end.&nbsp; No one, save the
Queen, professed to entertain any hope of his amendment; but Catherine
appeared to be too lethargic to allow herself to be roused to any understanding
of his danger; and as to the personal womanly tendance of wife to suffering
husband, she seemed to have no notion of it.&nbsp; Her mother had never
been supposed to take the slightest care of King Charles; and Catherine,
after her example, regarded the care either of husband or child as no
more required of a royal lady than of a queen bee.</p>
<p>The little Lady Montagu, as Alice was now to be called, who had been
scheming that her Richard should be wounded just enough to learn to
call her his good little nurse-tender, was dreadfully scandalized, as
indeed were wives of more experience, when they found all their endeavours
to make their mistress understand how ill the King really was, and how
much he wished for her, fall upon uncomprehending ears, and at last
were desired by her mother Isabeau not to torment the poor Queen, or
they would make her ill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make her ill!&nbsp; I wish I could!&rsquo; muttered Lady Warwick,
as she left the presence-chamber; &lsquo;but it is like my little Nan
telling her apple-stock baby that all her kin were burnt alive in one
castle.&nbsp; She heeds as much!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But when at late evening Sir Lewis Robsart rode up to the hotel,
and a hush went along with him, for all knew that he would never have
left his King alive, Catherine&rsquo;s composure gave way.&nbsp; She
had not imagination enough for apprehension of what was out of sight;
but when she knew that she had lost her king, to whom she had owed the
brief splendour of an otherwise dreary and neglected life, she fell
into a passion of cries and tears, even at the mere sight of Sir Lewis,
and continued to bewail her king, her lord, her husband, her light,
her love, with the violence of an utterly unexpected bereavement.</p>
<p>But while her shrieks and sobs were rending the air, a hoarse voice
gasped out, &lsquo;What say you?&nbsp; My son Henri dead!&rsquo; and
white and ghastly, the gray hair hanging wildly from the temples, the
eyes roaming with the wistful gaze of the half insane, poor King Charles
stood among them, demanding, &lsquo;Tell me I am sick again!&nbsp; Tell
me it is but one of my delusions!&nbsp; So brave, so strong, so lively,
so good to the poor old man!&nbsp; My son Henri cannot die!&nbsp; That
is for the old, the sick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when Sir Lewis with gentle words had made him understand the
truth, he covered his face with his hands, and staggered away, led by
his attendant knight, still murmuring in a dazed way, &lsquo;<i>Mon
fils Henri, mon bon fils Henri</i>&mdash;most loving of all my children!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In truth, neither of his own sons had been thus mourned; nor had
any person shown the poor crazed monarch the uniform deferential consideration
he had received from Henry.&nbsp; He crept back to his own chamber,
and for many days hardly spoke, save to moan for his <i>bon fils Henri</i>,
scarcely tasting food, and pining away day by day.&nbsp; Those who had
watched the likeness between the heroes of Monmouth and of Macedon,
saw the resemblance carried out; for as the aged Persian queen perished
away from grief for the courteous and gentle Alexander, so now the king
of the conquered realm was actually wasting to death with mourning for
his frank and kindly <i>bon fils Henri</i>.</p>
<p>As part of royal etiquette, Catherine betook herself to her bed,
in a chamber hung with black, the light of day excluded, and ranks of
wax tapers shedding a lugubrious light upon rows of gentlemen and ladies
who had to stand there on duty, watching her as the mourners watched
the King, though her lying-in-state was not always as silent; for though,
there was much time spent in slumber, Catherine sometimes would indulge
in a good deal of subdued prattle with her mother, or her more confidential
attendants.&nbsp; But at other times, chiefly when first awaking, or
else when anything had crossed her will, she would fall into agonies
of passionate grief&mdash;weeping, shrieking, and rending her hair with
almost a frenzy of misery, as she called herself utterly desolate, and
screamed aloud for her king to return to her.</p>
<p>She was quite past the management of her English ladies on these
occasions; and her mother, declaring that she was becoming crazed like
her father, declined having anything to do with her.&nbsp; Even Sir
Lewis Robsart she used to spurn aside; and nothing ever seemed effectual,
but for the Demoiselle de Luxemburg, with her full sweet voice, and
force of will in all the tenderness of strength, caressingly to hold
her still, talk to her almost as to an infant, and sing away her violence
with some long low ditty&mdash;sometimes a mere Flemish lullaby, sometimes
a Church hymn.&nbsp; As Lady Warwick said, when the ladies were all
wearied out with the endeavour to control their Queen&rsquo;s waywardness
and violence, and it sighed away like a departing tempest before Esclairmonde,
&lsquo;It was as great a charity as ever ministering as a St. Katherine&rsquo;s
bedeswoman could be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the young Lady Montagu, the blow was astounding.&nbsp; It was
the first realization that a great man could die, a great support be
taken away; and, child-like, she moved about, bewildered and stunned,
in the great household on which the dark cloud had descended&mdash;clinging
to Esclairmonde as if to protect her from she knew not what; anything
dreadful might happen, with the King dead, and her father and husband
away.</p>
<p>Alas! poor Esclairmonde!&nbsp; She was in much more real danger herself,
as came to the bride&rsquo;s mind presently, when, in the midst of her
lamentations, she exclaimed, &lsquo;And, ah, Clairette! there ends his
goodly promise about the sisterhood of good works at Paris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde responded with a gesture of sorrow, and the murmur of
the &lsquo;<i>In principibus non confide</i>&rsquo; that is so often
the echo of disappointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what will you do?&rsquo; continued Alice, watching her
anxiously, as her face, turning very pale, was nevertheless uplifted
towards heaven.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strive to trust more in God, less in princes,&rsquo; she breathed
forth, clasping her hands, and compressing her lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, but does it grieve you so intensely?&rsquo; asked Alice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mayhap&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas! sweet one!&nbsp; I would that the fall of this device
seemed like to be the worst effect to me of your good king&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
Pray for me, Alice, for now no earthly power stands between me and my
kinsmen&rsquo;s will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alice cried aloud, &lsquo;Nay, nay, lady, we are English still.&nbsp;
There are my father; my lord, the Duke of Bedford; they will not suffer
any wrong to be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, Alice.&nbsp; None of them hath any power to aid me.&nbsp;
Even good King Henry had no legal power to protect me; only he was so
great, so strong in word or deed, that no man durst do before him what
he declared a shame and a sin.&nbsp; Now it will be expedient more than
ever that nothing be done by the English to risk offending the Duke
of Burgundy.&nbsp; None will dare withhold me; none ought to dare, for
they act not for themselves, but for their infant charge; and my countess
is weary of me.&nbsp; There is nothing to prevent my uncles from taking
me away with them; or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing!&rsquo; cried Alice.&nbsp; &lsquo;It cannot be!&nbsp;
Oh, that my father were here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He could do nothing for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A convent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No convent here could keep me against the Bishop of Th&eacute;rouenne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alice wrung her hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, it cannot&mdash;shall not
be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Alice, I do not believe it will be.&nbsp; I have that
confidence in Him to whom I have given myself, that I do not believe
He will permit me to be snatched from Him, so long as my will does not
consent.&rsquo;&nbsp; Esclairmonde faltered a moment, as she remembered
her wavering, crossed her hands on her breast, and ejaculated, &lsquo;May
He deal mercifully with me!&nbsp; Yet it may be at an exceeding cost&mdash;at
that of all my cherished schemes, of all that was pride and self-seeking.&nbsp;
Alice, look not so terrified.&nbsp; Nothing can be done immediately,
or with violence, in this first mourning for the King; and I trust to
make use of the time to disguise me, and escape to England, where I
may keep my vow as anchoress, or as lay sister.&nbsp; Let me keep that,
and my self-exalting schemes shall be all put by!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The question whether this should be to England, or to the southern
parts of France held by the Armagnacs, remained for decision, as opportunity
should direct: Alice constantly urging her own scheme of carrying her
friend with her as her tire-woman, if, as seemed likely, she were sent
home; and Esclairmonde refusing to consent to anything that might bring
the bride into troubles with her father and husband; and the debates
being only interrupted when the Lady Montagu was required to take her
turn among the weary ladies-in-waiting around Catherine&rsquo;s state
bed.</p>
<p>Whenever she was not required to control, console, or persuade the
Queen, Esclairmonde spent most of her time in a chamber apart from the
chatter of Jaqueline&rsquo;s little court, where she was weaving, in
the delicate point-lace work she had learnt in her Flemish convent,
an exquisite robe, such as were worn by priests at Mass.&nbsp; She seldom
worked, save for the poor; but she longed to do some honour to the one
man who would have promoted her nearly vanished scheme, and this work
she trusted to offer for a vestment to be used at his burial Mass.&nbsp;
Many a cherished plan was resigned, many an act of self-negation uttered,
as she bent over the dainty web; many an entreaty breathed, that her
moment&rsquo;s wandering of fancy might not be reckoned against her,
but that she might be aided to keep the promise of her infancy, and
devote herself undivided to the direct service of God and of His poor,
be it in ever so humble a station.</p>
<p>Here she sat alone, when steps approached, the door opened, and of
all people he stood before her whom she least wished to see, the young
Lord of Glenuskie.</p>
<p>Amazed as she was, she betrayed no confusion, and merely rose, saying
quietly, &lsquo;This is an error.&nbsp; I will show you Madame&rsquo;s
apartment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Malcolm, who had begun by looking far more confused than she,
cried earnestly, &lsquo;One moment, lady.&nbsp; I came not willingly;
the Countess sent for me to her.&nbsp; But since I am here&mdash;listen
while Heaven gives me strength to say it&mdash;I will trouble you never
again.&nbsp; I am come to a better mind.&nbsp; Oh, forgive me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you here then for, Sir?&rsquo; said Esclairmonde,
with the same defensive dignity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My king sent me, against my will, on a mission to the Queen,&rsquo;
panted Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am forced to wait here; or, lady, I should
have been this day doing penance for my pursuit of you.&nbsp; Verily
I am a penitent.&nbsp; Mayhap Heaven will forgive me, if you will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I understand you aright, it is well,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde,
still gravely and doubtfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is so indeed,&rsquo; protested Malcolm, with a terrible
wrench to his heart, yet a sensation of freeing his conscience.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fear me no longer now.&nbsp; After that which I saw at Vincennes,
I know what it is to be on the straight path, and&mdash;oh! what it
is to have fallen from it.&nbsp; How could I dream of dragging you down
to be with one so unworthy, becoming more worthless each day?&nbsp;
Lady, if I never see you more, pardon me, pray for me, as a saint for
a poor outcast on earth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde; &lsquo;I am no saint&mdash;only
a maiden pledged.&nbsp; But, Sir, I thank you fervently.&nbsp; You have
lightened my heart of one of my fears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm could not but be cheered by being for once spoken to by her
in so friendly a tone; and he added, gravely and resolutely: &lsquo;My
suit, then, I yield up, lady&mdash;yield for ever.&nbsp; Am I permitted
once to kiss that fair and holy hand, as I resign my presumptuous hopes
thereof?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mayhap it were wiser left undone,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My mind misgives me that this meeting is planned to bring us
into trouble.&nbsp; Farewell, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she had apprehended, the door was flung back, and Countess Jaqueline
rushed in, clasping her hands in an affectation of merry surprise, as
she cried, &lsquo;Here they are!&nbsp; See, Monseigneur!&nbsp; No keeping
doves apart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, turning on her with cold
dignity, &lsquo;I have been thanking Monsieur de Glenuskie for having
resigned the suit that I always declared to be in vain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You misunderstood, Clairette,&rsquo; said Jaqueline.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No gentleman ever so spoke!&nbsp; No, no; my young lord has kept
his promise to me, and I will not fail him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; faltered Malcolm, &lsquo;I came by command
of the King of Scots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the better,&rsquo; cried Jaqueline.&nbsp; &lsquo;So
he can play into our hands, for all his grandeur!&nbsp; It will lose
him his wager, though!&nbsp; Here is bride&mdash;there is priest&mdash;nay,
bishop!&rsquo; pointing to him of Th&eacute;rouenne, who had accompanied
her, but hitherto had stood silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;the time and state of
the household forbid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Ma foi</i>!&nbsp; What is that to us?&nbsp; King Henry
is neither our brother nor our father; and Catherine will soon laugh
at it as a good joke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said the Bishop, with more propriety, &lsquo;it
is the contract and troth-plight alone that could take place at present.&nbsp;
That secure, the full solemnities will await a fitting time; but it
is necessary that the troth be exchanged at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monseigneur,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, &lsquo;mine is in other
keeping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, Monseigneur,&rsquo; added Malcolm, &lsquo;I have just
told the lady that I repent of having fallen from my vocation, and persecuted
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How, Sir!&rsquo; said the Bishop, turning on him; &lsquo;do
you thus lightly treat a lady of the house of Luxemburg?&nbsp; Beware!&nbsp;
There are those who know how to visit an insult on a malapert lad, who
meddles with the honour of the family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be not threatened, Lord Malcolm,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde,
with a gleam in her eye.</p>
<p>And Malcolm was Stewart enough to answer with spirit: &lsquo;My lord,
I will meet them if needed.&nbsp; This lady is so affianced, that it
is sacrilege to aspire to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the Bishop, in an audible aside to the giggling
Countess: &lsquo;this comes of her having thrown herself at the youth&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; Now he will no more of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Crimson with wrath, and also with a wild sense of hope that the obligation
had become absolute, Malcolm made a vehement incoherent exclamation;
but Esclairmonde retained her composure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monseigneur and Madame both know better,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is but another menace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Peace, minion,&rsquo; said the Bishop of Th&eacute;rouenne,
&lsquo;and listen to me.&nbsp; If this young gentleman, after professing
himself willing to wed you, now draws back, so much the worse for him.&nbsp;
But if you terrify him out of it with your humours, then will my brother
St. Pol and the Duke of Burgundy soon be here, with no King of England
to meddle; and by St. Adrian, Sir Bo&euml;mond will be daunted by no
airs, like Monsieur there.&nbsp; A bride shall you be, Esclairmonde
de Luxemburg, ere the week is out, if not to Monsieur de Glenuskie,
to the Chevalier Bo&euml;mond de Bourgogne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look not at me,&rsquo; said Jaqueline.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am weary
of your contumacy.&nbsp; All I shall do is to watch you well.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve suspected for some days that you were concocting mischief
with the little Montagu; but you&rsquo;ll not escape again, as when
I was fool enough to help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two stood a few paces apart, where they had been discovered;
Esclairmonde&rsquo;s eyes were closed, her hands clasped, as if in silent
prayer for aid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Girl&mdash;your choice!&rsquo; said the Bishop, peremptorily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wedlock on the spot to this gentleman, or to Sir Bo&euml;mond
a week hence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde was very white.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My will shall not consent to a present breach of vow to save
a future one,&rsquo; she said, in a scarce audible voice.</p>
<p>A sudden thought darted into Malcolm&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; With colour
flooding his face to his very temples, he stepped nearer to her, and
said, in a tremulous under-tone, &lsquo;Lady, trust me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop withheld Jaqueline almost by force, so soon as he saw
that the pair were whispering together, and that there was something
of relaxation in Esclairmonde&rsquo;s face as she looked up at him in
silent interrogation.</p>
<p>He spoke low, but solemnly and imploringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Trust me
with your plight, lady, and I will restore it when you are free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hardly able to speak, she however murmured, &lsquo;You will indeed
do this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So help me Heaven!&rsquo; he said, and his eyes grew large
and bright; he held his head with the majesty of his race.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heaven has sent you,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, with a long
sigh, and holding out her hand to him, as though therewith she conferred
a high-souled woman&rsquo;s full trust.</p>
<p>And Malcolm took it with a strange pang of pain and exultation at
the heart.&nbsp; The trust was won, but the hope of earthly joy was
gone for ever.</p>
<p>The Countess broke out with a shout of triumph: &lsquo;There, there!
they have come to reason at last.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s an end of her
folly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm felt himself a man, and Esclairmonde&rsquo;s protector, all
at once, as he stood forth, still holding her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monseigneur,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this lady consents to
intrust her troth to me, and be affianced to me&rsquo;&mdash;his chest
heaved, but he still spoke firmly&mdash;&lsquo;on condition that no
word be spoken of the matter, nor any completion of the rite take place
until the mourning for King Henry be at an end;&rsquo; and, at a sort
of shiver from Esclairmonde, he added: &lsquo;Not for a year, by which
time I shall be of full age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A strange bridegroom!&rsquo; said Jaqueline; &lsquo;but maybe
you do well to get her on what terms you can.&nbsp; Do you agree, Monseigneur?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In truth, Monseigneur may have been relieved that the trial of strength
between him and his ward had thus terminated.&nbsp; He was only anxious
to have the matter concluded.</p>
<p>The agreement, binding Malcolm to accept a stated number of crowns
in instalments, as the value of Esclairmonde&rsquo;s lands, under the
guarantee of the Duke of Burgundy and King James of Scotland, had all
been long ago signed, sealed, and secured; and there was nothing to
prevent the <i>fiancailles</i>, or espousals, from taking place at once.</p>
<p>It was a much more real ceremony than a mere betrothal, being, in
fact, in the eye of the civil law a marriage, though the full blessing
and the sacramental words of union were deferred for the completion
of the rite.&nbsp; It was the first part of the Marriage Service, binding
the pair so indissolubly to one another, that neither could enter into
wedlock with any one else as long as the other lived&mdash;except, of
course, by Papal dispensation; and in cases of stolen weddings, it was
all that was deemed needful.</p>
<p>All therefore that remained to be done was, that the Bishop summoned
his chaplain to serve as a witness and as scribe; and then the two young
people, in their deep mourning dresses, standing before the Bishop,
vowed to belong to none other than to one another, and the betrothal
rings being produced, were placed on their fingers, and their hands
were clasped.&nbsp; Malcolm&rsquo;s was steady, as he felt Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
rest in his untrembling, but with the quietness of one who trusted all
in all where she trusted at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor children! they have all to learn,&rsquo; hilariously
shouted the Countess.&nbsp; &lsquo;They have forgotten the kiss!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you suffer it, my sister?&rsquo; said Malcolm, with burning
cheeks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother and my guardian!&rsquo; responded Esclairmonde,
raising the white brow to his lips.</p>
<p>At that moment back went the door, and in flew Alice Montagu, crying
aloud, &lsquo;Clairette! the Queen&mdash;oh, Madame, your pardon! but
I am sent for Esclairmonde.&nbsp; The Queen is in worse fits than ever.&nbsp;
Sir Lewis can&rsquo;t get the ring from her.&nbsp; They think she will
rave like her father presently!&nbsp; Come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde could only hurry away at this; while Alice, grasping
her hand, continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, have they been persecuting you?&nbsp; I dreaded it when
I saw yon little wretch; but&mdash;oh, Esclairmonde, what is this?&rsquo;
in an utterly changed voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He holds my faith in trust.&nbsp; He will restore it,&rsquo;
said Esclairmonde, hurriedly.</p>
<p>But Lady Montagu spoke not another word; and, indeed, they were hard
upon the English queen&rsquo;s rooms, whence they already heard hysterical
screams of passion.</p>
<p>Jaqueline had immediately set forth in the same direction out of
curiosity; and Malcolm in much anxiety, since the mission that he had
been cautioned to guard so jealously seemed in danger of being known
everywhere.&nbsp; He had himself been allowed to stand by the Queen&rsquo;s
bedside, and rehearse James&rsquo;s message; but when he had further
hinted of his being sent by Bedford to bring the ring, the Queen, perhaps
at the mention of the brother-in-law, pouted, knew nothing of any ring,
and supposed M. le Duc meant to strip her, a poor desolate widow, of
all her jewels.</p>
<p>Then Malcolm had spoken in private with Sir Lewis Robsart, who knew
the ring was among her jewels, and promised to get it for him as soon
as was possible; and it was while waiting for this that Malcolm had
been summoned to the Countess of Hainault&rsquo;s apartments.</p>
<p>But ere Sir Lewis could get the ear of the Queen, as he now told
Malcolm, her mother had been with her.&nbsp; Catherine was dull, jealous,
unwilling to part with anything, but always easily coaxed over.&nbsp;
Her mother Isabeau had, on the other hand, a good deal of low cunning
and selfishness, and understood how valuable an instrument might be
a duplicate seal of a deceased monarch.&nbsp; Therefore she instigated
her daughter to deny that she possessed it, and worked her up into a
state of impracticability, in which Sir Lewis Robsart was unable to
deal with her, and only produced so wild a tempest of passion as perfectly
to appal both him and her ladies.</p>
<p>That the Duke of Bedford had sent for a ring, which she would not
give up, was known over the whole palace; the only matter still not
perhaps known was, what was the value of that individual ring.</p>
<p>Robsart, however, promised to exonerate Malcolm from having shown
any indiscretion; he charged it all on himself for having left his Queen
for an instant to Isabeau.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Malcolm and he, with other nobles and ladies, waited,
waited in the outer chamber, listening to the fearful storm of shrieks
and cries, till they began to spend themselves and die away; and then
they heard Esclairmonde&rsquo;s low voice singing her lullaby, and every
one breathed freer, as though relieved, and murmurs of conversation
rose again.&nbsp; Malcolm moved across to greet the Lady Montagu; and
though she looked at him with all the disdain her little gentle face
could accomplish, he had somehow a spring and strength in him that could
not now be brow-beaten.</p>
<p>He bent over her, and said, &lsquo;Lady, I see you know all.&nbsp;
It is but a trust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you so treat it, Sir, you will do well,&rsquo; responded
the young matron, with as much stern gravity as she could assume; the
fact being that she longed to break down and cry heartily, that Esclairmonde
should so far have failed, and become like other people.</p>
<p>Long, long they waited&mdash;Malcolm with a strange dreamy feeling
at his heart, neither triumph nor disappointment, but something between
both, and peace above all.&nbsp; Dinner was served in the hall; the
company returned to the outer apartment, yet still all was silent within;
till at last, late in the afternoon, there came a black figure forth
from under the black hangings, and Esclairmonde, turning to Lady Warwick,
said, &lsquo;The Queen is awake, and desires her ladies&rsquo; presence.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then coming towards Malcolm, who was standing near Sir Lewis Robsart,
she placed in his hand the signet-ring.</p>
<p>Both, while the attendants of the Queen filed back into her chamber,
eagerly demanded how the ring had been obtained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor lady!&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, &lsquo;she was too much
spent to withhold anything.&nbsp; She was weak and exhausted with cries
and tears; and when she had slept, she was as meek as a lamb; and there
was no more ado but to bid her remember that the blessed King her lord
would have bidden her let the ring be broken up at once, lest it should
be used so as to harm her son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That Esclairmonde had prevailed by that gentle force of character
which no one could easily resist, could not, however, be doubted for
a moment; and a fresh thrill of amazement, and almost of joy, came over
Malcolm at the sense that he had become the protector of such a being,
and that in a sort she belonged to him, and was in his power, having
trusted herself to him.</p>
<p>Robsart advised, and Esclairmonde concurred in the counsel, that
Lord Glenuskie should set forth for Vincennes immediately, before there
should be time for any more cabals, or for Queen Isabeau to have made
her daughter repent of having delivered up the signet-ring.</p>
<p>Malcolm therefore at once took leave of his affianced, venturing
to kiss her hand as he looked wistfully in her face, and said, &lsquo;Dear
lady, how shall I thank you for this trust?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde gave her sweet grave smile, as she said, &lsquo;To God&rsquo;s
keeping I commend you, Sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; She would not even bid him
be true to his trust; it would have seemed to her to insult him in whom
her confidence was placed, and she only added: &lsquo;I shall ever bless
you for having saved me.&nbsp; Farewell!&nbsp; Now am I bound for ever
to pray for you and your sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And it would be impossible to tell how the sense of Esclairmonde&rsquo;s
trust, and of the resolute self-denial it would require of him, elevated
Malcolm&rsquo;s whole tone, and braced his mind.&nbsp; The taking away
of his original high purpose had rendered him as aimless and pleasure-loving
as any ordinary lad; but the situation in which he now stood&mdash;guarding
this saintly being for her chosen destiny, at the expense of all possible
earthly projects for his own happiness or ambition&mdash;was such as
to bring out that higher side of his nature that had well-nigh collapsed.&nbsp;
As he stood alone in the ante-room, waiting until his horse and escort
should be ready for his return, a flood of happiness seemed to gush
over him.&nbsp; Esclairmonde was no more his own, indeed, than was King
Henry&rsquo;s signet; but the trust was very precious, and gave him
at least the power of thinking of her as joined by a closer link than
even his sister Lilias.&nbsp; And towards her his conscience was again
clear, for this very betrothal put marriage out of the question for
him, and was a real seal of his dedication.&nbsp; He only felt as if
his heart ought not to be so light and peaceful, while his penance was
still unsaid, his absolution not yet pronounced.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV: THE TRUST</h2>
<p>James of Scotland and John of Bedford sat together in the twilight
of a long and weary day, spent by the one in standing like a statue
at the head of his deceased friend as a part of the pageant of the lying-in-state
in the chapel, whither multitudes had crowded throughout the day to
see the &lsquo;mighty victor, mighty lord, lie low on his funeral couch;&rsquo;
the nobles gazing with a certain silent and bitter satisfaction at him
who had not only broken the pride of their country, but had with his
iron hand repressed their own private exactions, while the poor and
the peasants openly bewailed him as the father and the friend who had
stood between them and their harsh feudal lords.&nbsp; By the other,
the hours had passed in the press of toil and perplexity that had fallen
on him as the yet unaccredited representative of English power in France,
and in writing letters to those persons at home from whom he must derive
his authority.&nbsp; The hour of rest and relaxation was welcome to
both, though they chiefly spent it each leaning back in his chair in
silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your messenger is not come back,&rsquo; said Bedford, presently,
rousing himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may have been no easy task,&rsquo; replied James, not however
without uneasiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would,&rsquo; said Bedford, presently, &lsquo;that I had
writ the matter straight to Robsart.&nbsp; The lad is weak, and may
be tampered with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He knows that I have pledged my honour for him,&rsquo; said
James.</p>
<p>Bedford&rsquo;s thin lips moved at the corners.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said James, not angrily, &lsquo;the youth hath
in some measure disappointed me.&nbsp; The evil in him shot forth faster
than the good under this camp life; but methinks there is in him a certain
rare quality of soul that I loved him for at the first, and though it
hath lain asleep all this time, yet what he hath now seen seemed to
me about to work the change in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be so,&rsquo; said Bedford; &lsquo;and yet I would
I had not consented to his going where that woman of Hainault might
work on him to fret the Lady Esclairmonde.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James started somewhat as he remembered overruling this objection
of Malcolm&rsquo;s own making.&nbsp; &lsquo;She cannot have the insolence,&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>At that moment a hasty step approached; the door was opened with
scant ceremony, and Ralf Percy, covered from head to foot with blood,
hurried in breathless and panting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord Duke, your license!&nbsp; Here is Malcolm Stewart
set upon in the forest by robbers and stabbed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Slain?&nbsp; Dead?&rsquo; cried both princes, springing up
in horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alive still&mdash;in the chapel&mdash;asking for you, my lord,&rsquo;
said Percy.&nbsp; &lsquo;He bade us lay him there at the King&rsquo;s
feet; and as it was the readiest way to a priest, we did his bidding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor Malcolm!&rsquo; sighed James; and he and Bedford hastened
to obey the summons.</p>
<p>There was time on the way for Ralf Percy to give them the particulars.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We had gone forth&mdash;Trenton, Kitson, altogether some half-dozen
of us&mdash;for a mouthful of air in the forest after our guard all
day in the chapel, when about a mile from the Castle we heard a scuffle,
and clashing of arms.&nbsp; So breaking through the thicket, we saw
a score of fellows on horseback fully armed, and in the midst poor Glenuskie
dragged to the ground and struggling hard with two of them.&nbsp; We
drew our swords, hallooed, and leapt out; and the knaves never stayed
to see how many of us there were, but made off like the dastards they
were, but not till one had dealt poor Stewart this parting stroke.&nbsp;
He hath been bleeding like a sheep all the way home, and hath scarce
spoken but a thanksgiving for our having come in time, as he called
it, and to ask for Dr. Bennet and the Duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The words brought them to the door of the chapel, where for a time
the chants around King Henry had paused in the agitation of the new
arrival.&nbsp; As the black and white crowd of priests and monks opened
and made way for the King and Duke, they saw, in the full light of the
wax tapers, laid on a pile of cushions not far from King Henry&rsquo;s
feet, the figure of Malcolm, his riding-gown open at the breast, and
kerchiefs dyed and soaked with blood upon it; the black of his garments
and hair enhancing the ghastly whiteness of his face, and yet an air
of peace and joy in the eyes and in the folded hands, as Dr. Bennet
and another priest stood over him, administering those abbreviated rites
of farewell blessing which the Church sanctioned in cases of sudden
and violent death.&nbsp; The princes both stood aside, and presently
Malcolm faintly said, &lsquo;Thank God!&nbsp; I trusted to His mercy
to pardon!&nbsp; Now all would be well could I but see the Duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am here, dear youth,&rsquo; said Bedford, kneeling on one
side of him; while James, coming to the other side, spoke to him affectionately;
but to him Malcolm only replied by a fond clasp of the hand, giving
his sole attention to Bedford, to whom he held the signet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has cost too much,&rsquo; said Bedford, sadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Sir, this would be naught, save that I am all that lies
between her&mdash;the Lady Esclairmonde&mdash;and Bo&euml;mond of Burgundy;&rsquo;
and as at that moment Bedford saw the gold betrothal ring on the finger,
his countenance lost something of the pitying concern it had worn.&nbsp;
Malcolm detected the expression, and rallying his powers the more, continued:
&lsquo;Sir, there was no help&mdash;they vowed that she must choose
between Bo&euml;mond and me.&nbsp; On the faith of a dying man, I hold
her troth but in trust; I pledged myself to her to restore it when her
way is clear to her purpose.&nbsp; She would never be mine but in name.&nbsp;
And now who will save her?&nbsp; My life alone is between her and yonder
wolf.&nbsp; Oh, Sir Duke, promise me to save her, and I die content.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is mere waste of time!&rsquo; broke in the Duke.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where are the knave chirurgeons?&mdash;See, James, if the lad
dies, &rsquo;twill be from mere loss of blood; there is no inward bleeding;
and if there be no more loitering, he will do well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And seeing the surgeons at hand, he would have risen to make way,
but Malcolm held him fast, reiterating, &lsquo;Save her, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If your life guards her, throw it not away by thus dallying,&rsquo;
said Bedford, disengaging himself; while Malcolm groaned heavily, and
turned his heavy eyes to his royal friend, who said kindly, &lsquo;Fear
not, dear cousin; either thou wilt live, or he will be better than his
word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God will guard her, I know,&rsquo; said Malcolm; &lsquo;and
oh! my own dear lord, I need not ask you to be the brother to my poor
sister you have been to me.&nbsp; At least all will be clear for her
and Patie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust not yet,&rsquo; said James, smiling in encouragement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thou wilt live, my faithful laddie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm was spent and nearly fainting by this time, and all his reply
was a few gasps of &lsquo;Only say you pardon me all, my lord, and will
speak for <i>her</i> to the Duke! ask <i>her</i> prayers for me!&rsquo;
and as James sealed his few words of reply with a kiss, he closed his
eyes, and became unconscious; in which state he was conveyed to his
bed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have set his mind at rest,&rsquo; said James, somewhat
hurt, to the Duke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&nbsp; I!&rsquo; said Bedford.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot stir
a finger that could set us at enmity with Burgundy, for any lady in
the land.&nbsp; Moreover, if she have found means to secure herself
once, she can do so again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would you could have been more kind to my poor boy,&rsquo;
said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Methought I was the most reasonably kind of you all!&nbsp;
Had it not been mere murder to keep him there prating and bleeding,
I had asked of him what indiscretion had blown the secret and perilled
the signet.&nbsp; No robbers were those between Paris and Vincennes
in our midst, but men who knew what he bore.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bedford just restrained himself from saying, &lsquo;trust a Scot
again;&rsquo; but his manner had vexed and pained James, who returned
to Malcolm, and left him no more till called by necessity to his post
as King Henry&rsquo;s chief mourner, when the care of him was left to
Patrick Drummond and old Bairdsbrae; and Malcolm was a very tranquil
patient, who seemed to need nothing but the pleasure of looking at the
ring on his finger.&nbsp; The weapon had evidently touched no vital
part, and he was decidedly on the way to recovery, when on the second
evening Bedford met James, saying: &lsquo;I have seen Robsart.&nbsp;
It was no indiscretion of young Glenuskie&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was only
what comes of dealing with women.&nbsp; Can I see the boy without peril
to him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm was so much better, that there was no reason against the
Duke&rsquo;s admission, and soon Bedford&rsquo;s falcon-face looked
down on him in all its melancholy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, my Lord Glenuskie,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I thought
not to be sending you on a service of such risk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a welcome service,&rsquo; said Malcolm.</p>
<p>Bedford&rsquo;s brows knitted themselves for a moment as he said,
&lsquo;I came to ask whether you deem that this hurt was from a common
robber or <i>routier</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Assuredly not,&rsquo; said Malcolm, but very low; and looking
up into his face, as he added, &lsquo;This should be for your ear alone,
Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were left alone, and the Duke said: &lsquo;I have heard from
Robsart how the ring was obtained.&nbsp; You may spare that part of
the story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;when the Lady Esclairmonde&rsquo;
(for he was not to be balked of dwelling on that name with prolonged
delight) &lsquo;had brought me the ring, Sir Lewis Robsart advised my
setting forth without loss of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he told me,&rsquo; said the Duke; &lsquo;and likewise that
you took his words so literally as to set out with only three followers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, Sir; but he knew not wherefore.&nbsp; My escort had gone
forth into the city, and while they were being collected, a message
bade me to the Lady Esclairmonde&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; I went, suspecting
naught, but I found myself in presence of Madame of Hainault, and of
a veiled lady&mdash;who, my Lord&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She was broad in form, and had a trick of gasping as though over-fat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bedford nodded.&nbsp; Every one knew Queen Isabeau by these tokens.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She scarce spoke, my Lord; but the Countess Jaqueline pretended
to be in one of her merry moods.&nbsp; She told me one good turn deserved
another, and that, as in gratitude and courtesy bound, I must do her
the favour of either lending her the signet, or, if I would not let
it out of my hands, of setting it to a couple of parchments, which she
declared King Henry had promised to grant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The false woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, words told not on her.&nbsp; She laughed and clapped
her hands at whatever I said of honour, faith, or trust.&nbsp; She would
have it that it was a jest&mdash;nay, romping fashion, she seized my
hand, which I let her have, knowing it was only my own seal that was
on it.&nbsp; Never was I so glad that the signet being too small for
my fingers, it was in my bosom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knew you what the parchments bore?&rsquo; asked, Bedford,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One&mdash;so far as I could see&mdash;was of the Duke of Orleans&rsquo;
liberty,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;The other&mdash;pardon me,
Sir&mdash;it bore the names of Duke Humfrey and Countess Jaqueline.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The shameless wanton!&rsquo; broke forth Bedford.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
did you escape her at last, boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Malcolm, turning as red as loss of blood
permitted, &lsquo;she had not kept her hands off me; therefore when
she stood between me and the door, I told her that discourtesy was better
than trust-breaking, and while she jeered at my talking out of a book
of chivalry, I e&rsquo;en took her by the hands, lifted her aside, opened
the door, ran down-stairs, and so to the stables, where I mounted with
the only three men I could get together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bedford could not but laugh, as he added, &lsquo;Bravely done, Lord
Malcolm; but, I fear me, she will never forgive you.&nbsp; What next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I left word for the other fellows to join us at the hostel
by the gate, and tarried for them till I feared being here after the
gates were fast; then set out without them, and rode till, just within
the forest, a band of men, how many I cannot tell, were on us, and before
my sword was well drawn they had surrounded me, and seized my bridle.&nbsp;
One of them bade me submit quietly, and they would not harm me, if I
would yield up that which I wist of.&nbsp; I said I would sooner yield
my life than my trust; whereupon they mastered me, and dragged me off
my horse, and were rifling me, when I&mdash;knowing the Flemish accent
of that drunken fellow of the Countess&rsquo;s&mdash;called out, &ldquo;Shame
on you, Ghisbert!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then it was that he stabbed me, even
at the moment when the holy Saints sent brave Percy and the rest to
rush in upon them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sure it was Ghisbert?&rsquo; repeated Bedford, anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As certain as a man&rsquo;s voice can make me,&rsquo; said
Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Methinks, had I not named him, he would perhaps
have bound me to a tree, and left it to be thought that they were but
common thieves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Belike,&rsquo; said Bedford, thoughtfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
are beholden to you, my Lord Glenuskie; the whole state of England is
beholden to you for the saving of the confusion and evils the loss of
that ring would have caused.&nbsp; You can keep counsel, I wot well.&nbsp;
Then let all this matter of the Queen and Countess rest a secret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm looked amazed; and Bedford added: &lsquo;I cannot quarrel
with the woman, nor banish her from Court.&nbsp; Did we accuse her,
Holland would become Armagnac; nor is she subject of ours, to have justice
done on her.&nbsp; It is for her interest to hush the matter up, and
it must be ours too.&nbsp; If that knave Ghisbert ever gives me the
chance, he shall hang like a dog; but for the rest&mdash;&rsquo; he
shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;Ghisbert only meant to serve
his lady.&nbsp; Any vassal of mine would do the like for me or my sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bedford half smiled; then sighed and said: &lsquo;Once we were like
to get laws more obeyed than lords; but that is all over now!&nbsp;
Yet you, young Sir, have seen a great pattern; you will have great powers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; interrupted Malcolm, &lsquo;I pray you believe
me, great powers I shall not have.&nbsp; As I told you last night, I
do but hold this precious troth in trust!&nbsp; It must be a secret,
or it would not save her; but you&mdash;oh, Sir! you will believe that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be so,&rsquo; said Bedford, gravely, &lsquo;it is too
sacred a trust to be spoken of.&nbsp; You will deserve greater honour
if you keep your word, than ever you will receive from the world.&nbsp;
Farewell&mdash;and recover fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm did not meet with much encouragement from the few to whom
he thought fit to confide the conditions of his espousal.&nbsp; The
King allowed that he could not have acted otherwise, but was concerned
at it, because of the hindrance that might for years be interposed in
the way of his welfare; and secretly hoped that Malcolm, in his new
capacity, would so gain on Esclairmonde&rsquo;s esteem and gratitude,
as to win her affection, and that by mutual consent they would lay aside
their loftier promises, and take up their espousal where they had left
it.</p>
<p>And what James secretly desired, Sir Patrick Drummond openly recommended.&nbsp;
In his eyes, Malcolm would be no better than a fool if he let his ladye-love,
with all her lands, slip through his fingers, when she was lawfully
his own.&nbsp; Patrick held that a monastery was a good place to be
nursed in if wounded, and a convenience for disposing of dull or weakly
younger sons; and he preferred that there should be some holy men to
pray for those who did the hard and bloody work of the world; but he
had no desire that any one belonging to himself should plunge into extra
sanctity; and the more he saw Malcolm developing into a man among men,
the more he opposed the notion of his dedicating himself.</p>
<p>A man!&nbsp; Yes; Malcolm was rising from his bed notably advanced
in manliness.&nbsp; As the King&rsquo;s keen eye had seen from the first,
and as Esclairmonde had felt, there was an elevation, tenderness, and
refinement in his cast of character, which if left to his natural destiny
would have either worn out his life early in the world, or carried him
to the obscure shelter of a convent.&nbsp; In the novelty of the secular
life, and temptations of all kinds, dread of ridicule, and the flood
of excitements which came with reviving health, that very sensitiveness
led him astray; and the elevated aims fell with a heavier fall when
diverted from heavenly palaces to earthly ones.&nbsp; Self-reproach
and dejection drove him further from the right course, and in proportion
to the greater amount of conscience he had by nature, his character
was the more deteriorating.&nbsp; His deeds were far less evil in themselves
than those of many of his companions, but inasmuch as they were not
thoughtless in him, they were injuring him more.&nbsp; But the sudden
shock of Patrick&rsquo;s danger roused him to a new sense of shame.&nbsp;
King Henry&rsquo;s death had lifted his mind out of the earthly atmosphere,
and then the treasure of Esclairmonde&rsquo;s pure and perfect trust
seemed to be the one thing to be guarded worthily and truly.&nbsp; It
gave him weight, drew him out of himself, lifted him above the boyish
atmosphere of random self-indulgence and amusement.&nbsp; To be the
protector who should guard her vows for the heavenly Bridegroom to whom
her soul was devoted, was indeed a championship that in his eyes could
only have befitted Sir Galahad; and a Galahad would he strive to be,
so long as that championship held him to the secular life.&nbsp; James
and Bedford both told him he had won his spurs, and should have them
on the next fit occasion; but he had ceased to care for knighthood,
save in that half-consecrated aspect which he thought would render his
guardianship less unmeet for Esclairmonde.</p>
<p>She had not shunned to send him a kind greeting on hearing of his
wound, and by way of token a fresh leaf of vellum with a few more of
those meditations from Zwoll&mdash;meditations that he spelled over
from Latin into English, and dwelt upon in great tranquillity and soothing
of spirit during the days that he was confined to his bed.</p>
<p>These were not many.&nbsp; He was on his feet by the time the funeral
cavalcade was in readiness to move from Vincennes to convey Henry of
Monmouth to his last resting-place in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; Bedford
could not be spared to return to England, and was only to go as far
as Calais; and James of Scotland was therefore to act as chief mourner,
attended by his own small personal suite.</p>
<p>Sir Patrick Drummond&mdash;though, shrugging his shoulders, he muttered
that he should as soon have thought of becoming mourner at the foul
fiend&rsquo;s funeral as at the King of England&rsquo;s&mdash;could
not object to swell the retinue of his sovereign by his knighthood;
and though neither he nor Malcolm were in condition for a campaign,
both could ride at the slow pace of the mournful procession.</p>
<p>The coffin was laid on a great car, drawn by four black horses, and
surmounted by Henry&rsquo;s effigy, made in boiled leather and coloured
to the life, robed in purple and ermine, crown on head, sceptre and
orb in either hand.&nbsp; The great knights and nobles rode on each
side, carrying the banners of the Saints; and close behind came James
and Bedford, each with his immediate attendants; then the household
officers of the King, Fitzhugh his chamberlain, Montagu his cup-bearer,
Ralf Percy and his other squires, and all the rest.&nbsp; Four hundred
men-at-arms in black armour, with lances pointed downwards, formed the
guard behind; and the vanguard was of clergy, robed in white, bearing
banners and wax lights, and chanting psalms.&nbsp; At the border of
every parish, all the ecclesiastics thereto appertaining, parochial,
chantry, and monastic, turned out to meet the procession with their
tapers; escorted it to the principal church; performed Mass there, if
it were in the forenoon; and then accompanied the coffin to the other
limit of their ground, and consigned it to the clerks of the next parish.&nbsp;
At night, the royal remains always rested in a church, guarded by alternate
watches of the English men-at-arms, and sung over by the local clergy,
while the escort were quartered in the town, village, or abbey where
the halt chanced to be made.&nbsp; Very slow was this progress; almost
like a continual dream was that long column, moving, moving on&mdash;white
in front, black behind&mdash;when seen winding over a hill, or, sometimes,
the banners peering over the autumn foliage of some thicket, all composed
to profound silence and tardy measured tread; while the chants rose
and fell with the breeze, like unearthly music.&nbsp; Many moved on
more than half asleep; and others of the younger men felt like Ralf
Percy, who, for all his real sorrow for the King, declared that, were
it not for rushing out, morning and evening, for a bathe and a gallop,
to fly a hawk or chase a hare, he should some day run crazed, blow out
all the wax lights, or play some mad prank to break the intolerable
oppression.&nbsp; Malcolm smiled at this; but to him, still in the dreamy
inertness of recovery, this tranquil onward movement in the still autumn
weather had some thing in it of healing influence; and the sweet chants,
the continual offices of devotion, were accordant with his present tone
of mind, and deepened the purpose he had formed.</p>
<p>Queen Catherine and her ladies joined the funeral march at Rouen,
or rather followed it at a mile&rsquo;s interval; but the two trains
kept apart, and only occasional messages were sent from one to the other.&nbsp;
Some of the gentlemen, who had a wife or sister in the Queen&rsquo;s
suite, would ride at nightfall to pay her a hasty visit; but Malcolm&mdash;though
he longed to be sent&mdash;durst not intrude upon Esclairmonde; and
the Duke of Bedford was not only forced to spend all the evening and
half the night in business, but was not loth to put off the day of the
meeting with his dear sister Catherine&mdash;to say nothing of the &lsquo;Woman
of Hainault.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therefore it was not until all had arrived at Calais, where a fleet
was waiting to meet them, that any visits were openly made by the one
party to the other.</p>
<p>Bedford and James went together to the apartments of the Queen, and
while they saw her in private, Malcolm came blushing towards Esclairmonde,
and was welcomed by her with a frank smile, outstretched hand, and kind
inquiry after his recovery.</p>
<p>She treated him indeed as a brother, as one on whom she depended,
and had really wished to see and arrange with.&nbsp; She told him that
Alice Montagu and her husband were returning to England, and that her
little friend had so earnestly prayed her to abide with her at Middleham
for the present, that she had consented&mdash;&lsquo;until such time
as the way be open,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, with her steady patient
smile.</p>
<p>Malcolm bowed his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am glad you will not be forced
to be with your Countess,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor lady!&nbsp; Maybe I have spoken too plainly.&nbsp;
But I owe her much.&nbsp; I must ever pray for her.&nbsp; And you, my
lord?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;shall go to study at Oxford.&nbsp;
Dr. Bennet intends returning thither to continue his course of teaching,
and my king has consented to my studying with him.&nbsp; It will not
cut me off, lady, from that which you permit me to be.&nbsp; King Henry
and his brothers have all been scholars there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, slightly colouring.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is well.&nbsp; And truly I trust that matters may be so guided,
that care for me may not long detain you from more lasting vows&mdash;be
they of heaven or earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady,&rsquo; said Malcolm, earnestly, &lsquo;none who had
been plighted to you <i>could</i> pledge himself to aught else save
One above!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, feeling in himself, or seeing in Esclairmonde&rsquo;s face,
that he was treading on dangerous ground, he asked leave to present
to her his cousin, Patrick Drummond: and this was accordingly done;
the lady comporting herself with so much sweet graciousness, that the
good knight, as they left the hall, exclaimed: &lsquo;By St. Andrew,
Malcolm, if you let that maiden escape you now she is more than half-wedded
to you, you&rsquo;ll be the greatest fool in broad Scotland.&nbsp; Why,
she is a very queen for beauty, and would rule Glenuskie like a princess&mdash;ay,
and defend the Castle like Black Agnes of Dunbar herself!&nbsp; If you
give her up, ye&rsquo;ll be no better than a clod.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm and Patrick had been borne off by James&rsquo;s quitting
the Castle; Bedford remained longer, having affairs to arrange with
the Queen.&nbsp; As he left her, he too turned aside to the window where
Esclairmonde sat as usual spinning, and Lady Montagu not far off, but
at present absorbed by her father, who was to remain in France.</p>
<p>One moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and then Bedford stepped towards the
Demoiselle de Luxemburg, and greeted her.&nbsp; She looked up in his
face, and saw its settled look of sad patient energy, which made it
full ten years older in appearance than when they had sat together at
Pentecost, and she marked the badge that he had assumed, a torn-up root
with the motto, &lsquo;The root is dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! my lord, things are changed,&rsquo; she could not help
saying, as she felt that he yearned for comfort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Changed indeed!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;God&rsquo;s will be
done!&nbsp; Lady,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;you wot of that which once
passed between us.&nbsp; I was grieved at first that you chose a different
protector in your need.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You <i>could</i> not, my lord,&rsquo; faltered Esclairmonde,
crimson as she never had been when speaking to Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I <i>could</i> not,&rsquo; said Bedford; &lsquo;and, lady,
my purpose was to thank you for the generous soul that perceived that
so it is.&nbsp; You spared me from a cruel case.&nbsp; I have no self
any longer, Esclairmonde; all I am, all I have, all I can, must be spent
in guarding Harry&rsquo;s work for his boy.&nbsp; To all else I am henceforth
dead; and all I can do is to be thankful, lady, that you have spared
me the sorest trial of all, both to heart and honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde&rsquo;s eyes were downcast, as she said, &lsquo;Heaven
is the protector of those of true and kind purpose;&rsquo; and then
gathering courage, as being perfectly aware to whom Bedford must give
his hand if he would conciliate Burgundy, she added, &lsquo;And, verily,
Sir, the way of policy is this time a happy one.&nbsp; Let me but tell
you how I have known and loved gentle Lady Anne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bedford shook his head with a half smile and a heavy sigh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Time fails me, dear lady,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and I cannot
brook any maiden&rsquo;s praise, even from you.&nbsp; I only wait to
ask whether there be any way yet left wherein I can serve you.&nbsp;
I will strive to deal with your kinsmen to restore your lands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold!&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never for lands
of mine will I have your difficulties added to.&nbsp; No&mdash;let them
go!&nbsp; It was a vain, proud dream when I thought myself most humble,
to become a foundress; and if I know my kinsmen, they will be too much
angered to bestow on me the dower required by a convent.&nbsp; No, Sir;
all I would dare to inquire would be, whether you have any voice in
choosing the bedeswomen of St. Katharine&rsquo;s Hospital?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bedeswomen!&nbsp; They come chiefly from the citizens,
not from princely houses like yours!&rsquo; said John, in consternation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have done with princely houses,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A Flemish maiden would be of no small service among the many
whom trade brings to your port from the Netherlands, and my longing
has ever been to serve my Lord through His poor and afflicted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is my father&rsquo;s widow who holds the appointments,&rsquo;
said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;Between her and me there hath been little good-will,
but my dear brother&rsquo;s last act towards her was of forgiveness.&nbsp;
She may wish to keep well with us of the Regency&mdash;and more like
still, she will be pleased that one of so great a house as yours should
sue to her.&nbsp; I will give you a letter to her, praying her to remember
you at the next vacancy; and mayhap, if the Lady Montagu could take
you to visit her, you could prevail with her!&nbsp; But, surely, some
nunnery more worthy of your rank&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is none that I should love so well,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde,
smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mayhap I have learnt to be a vagabond, but I cannot
but desire to toil as well as pray.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are willing to wait for a vacancy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When once safe from my kinsmen, in England, I will wait under
my kind Alice&rsquo;s wing till&mdash;till it becomes expedient that
yonder gentleman be set free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You trust him?&rsquo; said Bedford.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Entirely,&rsquo; responded Esclairmonde, heartily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happy lad!&rsquo; half sighed the Duke; but, even as he did
so, he stood up to bid the lady adieu&mdash;lingering for a moment more,
to gaze at the face he had longed for permission to love&mdash;and thus
take leave of all his youth and joy, addressing himself again to that
burthen of care which in thirteen years laid him in his grave at Rouen.</p>
<p>As he left the Castle and came out into the steep fortified street,
Ralf Percy came up to him, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here, my lord, are
those two honest Yorkshire knights running all over Calais to make a
petition to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&mdash;Trenton and Kitson!&nbsp; I thought their year
of service was up, and they were going home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, my lord,&rsquo; said Kitson, who with his comrade had
followed close in Percy&rsquo;s wake, &lsquo;we were going home to bid
Mistress Agnes take her choice of us; but this morn we&rsquo;ve met
a pursuivant that is come with Norroy King-at-arms, and what doth he
but tell us that no sooner were our backs turned, than what doth Mistress
Agnes but wed&mdash;ay, wed outright&mdash;one Tom of the Lee, a sneaking
rogue that either of us would have beat black and blue, had we ever
seen him utter a word to her?&nbsp; A knight&rsquo;s lady&mdash;not
to say two&mdash;as she might have been!&nbsp; So, my lord, we not being
willing to go home and be a laughing-stock, crave your license to be
of your guard as we were of King Harry&rsquo;s, and show how far we
can go among the French.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And welcome; no good swords can be other than welcome!&rsquo;
said Bedford, not diverted as his brother would have been, but with
a heartiness that never failed to win respectful affection.</p>
<p>Long did James and Bedford walk up and down the Castle court together,
while the embarkation was going on.&nbsp; The question weighed on them
both whether they should ever meet more, after eighteen years of youth
spent together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Youth is gone,&rsquo; said Bedford.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have been
under a mighty master, and now God help us to do his work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo; said James; &lsquo;but for me&mdash;it is like
to be the library and the Round Tower again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scarcely,&rsquo; said Bedford, &lsquo;the Beauforts will never
rest till Joan is on a throne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Bedford, &lsquo;the Bishop of Winchester will
be no small power, you will find.&nbsp; Would that I could throw up
this France and come home, for he and Humfrey will clash for ever.&nbsp;
James, an you love me, see Humfrey alone, and remind him that all the
welfare of Harry&rsquo;s child may hang on his forbearance&mdash;on
union with the Bishop.&nbsp; Tell him, if he ever loved the noblest
brother that ever lived, to rein himself in, and live only for the child&rsquo;s
good, not his own.&nbsp; Tell him that Bedford and Gloucester must be
nothing henceforth&mdash;only heads and hands doing Harry&rsquo;s will
for his babe.&nbsp; Oh, James, what can you tell Humfrey that will make
him put himself aside?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have writ to him Harry&rsquo;s words as to Dame Jac?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wanton! ay, I have; and if you can whisper in his ear
that matter of Malcolm and the signet, it might lessen his inclination.&nbsp;
But,&rsquo; he sighed, &lsquo;I have little hope, James; I see nothing
for Lancaster but that which the old man at York invoked upon us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet, when I look at you and Humfrey, and think of the contrast
with my own father&rsquo;s brethren, I see nothing but hope and promise
for England,&rsquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must do our best, however heavy-hearted,&rsquo; said John
of Bedford, pausing in his walk, and standing steadfast.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
rod becomes a palm to those who do not freshly bring it on themselves.&nbsp;
May this poor child of Harry&rsquo;s be bred up so that he may be fit
to meet evil or good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor child,&rsquo; repeated James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Were he not
there, and you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Peace, James,&rsquo; said Bedford; &lsquo;it is well that
such a weight is not added!&nbsp; While I act for my nephew, I know
my duty; were it for myself, methinks I should be crazed with doubts
and questions.&nbsp; Well,&rsquo; as a messenger came up with tidings
that all was ready, &lsquo;fare thee well, Jamie.&nbsp; In you I lose
the only man with whom I can speak my mind, or take counsel.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
not let me gain a foe, as well as lose a friend, when you get home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, in heart, John!&rsquo; said the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;As
to hand&mdash;Scotland must be to England what she will have her.&nbsp;
Would that I saw my way thither!&nbsp; Windsor will have lost all that
made captivity well-nigh sweet.&nbsp; And so farewell, dear brother.&nbsp;
I thank you for the granting to me of this sacred charge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so, with hands clasped and wrung together, with tears raining
from James&rsquo;s eyes, and a dry settled melancholy more sad than
tears on John&rsquo;s countenance, the two friends parted, never again
to meet; each to run a course true, brave, and short&mdash;extinguished
the one in bitter grief, the other in blood.</p>
<p>On All Saints&rsquo; Day, while James stood with Humfrey of Gloucester
at the head of the grave at Westminster, where Henry&rsquo;s earthly
form was laid to rest amid the kings his fathers, amid the wail of a
people as sorrowful as if they knew all the woes that were to ensue,
Bedford was in like manner standing over a grave at the Royal Abbey
of St. Denis.&nbsp; He, the victor&rsquo;s brother, represented all
the princely kindred of Charles VI. of France, and, with his heart at
Westminster, filled the chief mourner&rsquo;s place over the king who
had pined to death for his conqueror.</p>
<p>The same infant was proclaimed king over each grave&mdash;heir to
France and England, to Valois and Lancaster.&nbsp; Poor child, his real
heirloom was the insanity of the one and the doom of the other!&nbsp;
Well for him that there was within him that holy innocence that made
his life a martyrdom!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI: THE CAGE OPEN</h2>
<p>More than a year had passed, and it was March when Malcolm was descending
the stone stair that leads so picturesquely beneath the archway of its
tower up to the hall of the college of St. Mary Winton, then <i>really</i>
New College.&nbsp; He had been residing there with Dr. Bennet, associating
with the young members of the foundation educated at Winchester, and
studying with all the freshness of a recent institution.&nbsp; It had
been a very happy time for him, within the gray stone walls that pleasantly
recalled Coldingham, though without Coldingham&rsquo;s defensive aspect,
and with ample food for the mind, which had again returned to its natural
state of inquiring reflection and ardour for knowledge.</p>
<p>Daily Malcolm woke early, attended Matins and Mass in the chapel,
studied grammar and logic, mastered difficult passages in the Fathers,
or copied out portions for himself in the chamber which he as a gentleman
commoner, as we should call him, possessed, instead of living in a common
dormitory with the other scholars.&nbsp; Or in the open cloister he
listened and took notes of the lectures of the fellows and tutors of
the college, and seated on a bench or walking up and down received special
instructions.&nbsp; Then ensued the meal, spread in the hall; the period
of recreation, in the meadows, or in the licensed sports, or on the
river; fresh studies, chapel, and a social but quiet evening over the
supper in the hall.&nbsp; All this was varied by Latin sermons at St.
Mary&rsquo;s, or disputations and lectures by notable doctors, and public
arguments between scholars, by which they absolutely fought out their
degrees.&nbsp; There were few colleges as yet, and those resident in
them were the <i>&eacute;lite</i>; beyond, there was a great mob of
scholars living in rooms as they could, generally very poor, and often
very disorderly; but they did not mar the quiet semi-monastic stillness
within the foundations, and to Malcolm it seemed as if the truly congenial
home was opened.</p>
<p>The curriculum of science began to reveal itself to him with all
the stages so inviting to a mind conscious of power and longing for
cultivation.&nbsp; The books, the learned atmosphere, the infinite possibilities,
were delightful to him, and opened a more delightful future.&nbsp; His
metaphysical Scottish mind delighted in the scholastic arguments that
were now first set before him, and his readiness, appreciation, and
eager power of acquiring surprised his teachers, and made him the pride
of New College.</p>
<p>When he looked back at his year of court and camp, he could only
marvel at having ever preferred them.&nbsp; In war his want of bodily
strength would make real distinction impossible; here he felt himself
excelling; here was absolute enjoyment, and of a kind without drawback.&nbsp;
Scholarship must be his true element and study: the deep universal study
of the sisterhood of science that the University offered was his veritable
vocation.&nbsp; Surely it was not without significance that the ring
that shone on his finger betrothed him to Esclairmonde, the Light of
the World; for though in person the maiden was never to be his own,
she was the emblem to him of the pure virgin light of truth and wisdom
that he would be for ever wooing, and winning only to see further lights
beyond.&nbsp; Human nature felt a pang at the knowledge that he was
bound to deliver up the ring and resign his connection with that fair
and stately maiden; but the pain that had been sore at first had diminished
under the sense that he stood in a post of generous trust, and that
his sacrifice was the passport to her grateful esteem.&nbsp; He knew
her to be with Lady Montagu, awaiting a vacancy at St. Katharine&rsquo;s,
and this would be the signal for dissolving the contract of marriage,
after which his present vision was to bestow Lilias upon Patrick, make
over his estates to them, take minor orders, and set forth for Italy,
there to pursue those deeper studies in theology and language for which
Padua and Bologna were famous.&nbsp; It was many months since he had
heard of Lilias; but this did not give him any great uneasiness, for
messengers were few, and letter-writing far from being a common practice.&nbsp;
He had himself written at every turning-point of his life, and sent
his letters when the King communicated with Scotland; but from his sister
he had heard nothing.</p>
<p>He had lately won his first degree as Bachelor of Arts, and was descending
the stair from the Hall after a Lenten meal on salt fish, when he saw
below him the well-known figure of King James&rsquo;s English servant,
who doffing his cap held out to him a small strip of folded paper, fastened
by a piece of crimson silk and the royal seal.&nbsp; It only bore the
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>To our right trusty and well-beloved Cousin
the Lord Malcolm Stewart of Glenuskie this letter be taken</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;DEAR COUSIN,</p>
<p>&lsquo;We greet you well, and pray you to come to us without loss
of time, having need of you, we being a free man and no captive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours,<br />
&lsquo;JAMES R.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Written at the Castle of Windsor this St. David&rsquo;s Day,
1424.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;A free man:&rsquo; the words kept ringing in Malcolm&rsquo;s
ears while he hastened to obtain license from Warden John Bonke, and
to take leave of Dr. Bennet.&nbsp; He had not left Oxford since the
beginning of his residence there.&nbsp; Vacations were not general dispersions
when ways and means of transit were so scarce and tardy, and Malcolm
had been long without seeing his king.&nbsp; Joy on his sovereign&rsquo;s
account, and his country&rsquo;s, seemed to swallow up all other thoughts;
as to himself, when he bade his friends and masters farewell, he declared
it was merely for a time, and when they shook their heads and augured
otherwise, he replied: &lsquo;Nay, think you I could live in the Cimmerian
darkness yonder, dear sirs?&nbsp; Our poor country hath nothing better
than mere monastery schools, and light of science having once shone
on me, I cannot but dwell in her courts for ever!&nbsp; Soon shall I
be altogether her son and slave!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Malcolm was full of eagerness, and pressed on rapidly
through the lanes between Oxford and Windsor, rejoicing to find himself
amid the noble trees of the forest, over which arose in all its grandeur
the Castle and Round Tower, as beautiful though less unique than now,
and bearing on it the royal standard, for the little King was still
nursed there.</p>
<p>Under the vaulted gateway James&mdash;with Patrick and Bairdsbrae
behind him&mdash;met Malcolm, and threw his arms round him, crying:
&lsquo;Ay, kiss me, boy; &rsquo;tis a king and no caitiff you kiss now!&nbsp;
Another six weeks, and then for the mountain and the moor and the bonnie
north countree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why not for a month?&rsquo; was Malcolm&rsquo;s question,
as hand and eye and face responded heartily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&nbsp; Why, because moneys must be told down, and treaties
signed; ay, and Lent is no time for weddings, nor March for southland
roses to travel to our cold winds.&nbsp; Ay, Malcolm, you see a bridegroom
that is to be!&nbsp; Did you think I was going home without her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not think you would be in such glee even at being free,
my lord, if you were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, Malcolm, ken ye of ony fair Scottish lassie&mdash;a
cousin of mine ain, who could be had to countenance my bride at our
wedding, and ride with us thereafter to Scotland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know whom your Grace means,&rsquo; said Malcolm, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An if you do, maybe, Malcolm, sin she bides not far frae the
border, ye&rsquo;d do me the favour of riding with Sir Patrick here,
and bringing her to the bridal,&rsquo; said the King, making his accent
more home-like and Scottish than Malcolm had ever heard it before.</p>
<p>The happiness of that spring afternoon was surpassing.&nbsp; The
King linked his arm into Malcolm&rsquo;s, and walked up and down with
him on the slopes, telling him all that had led to this consummation;
how Walter Stewart and his brothers had become so insolent and violent
as to pass the endurance of their father the Regent, as well as of all
honest Scots; and how, after secret negotiations and vain endeavours
to obtain from him a pledge of indemnity for all that had happened,
the matter had been at length opened with Gloucester, Beaufort, and
the Council.&nbsp; The Scottish nation, with Albany at the head, was
really recalling the King.&nbsp; This was the condition on which Henry
V. had always declared that he should be liberated; these were the terms
on which he had always hoped to return; and his patience was at last
rewarded.&nbsp; Bedford had sent his joyful consent, and all was now
concluded.&nbsp; James was really free, and waited only for his marriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not tell you, Malcolm, while there might yet be a
slip between cup and lip,&rsquo; said the King; &lsquo;it might have
hindered the humanities; and yet I needed you as much when I was glad
as when all seemed like to fail!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had Patrick,&rsquo; said Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Patrick&rsquo;s a tall and trusty fellow,&rsquo; said the
King, &lsquo;with a shrewd wit, and like to be a right-hand man; but
there&rsquo;s something in you, Malcolm, that makes a man turn to you
for fellow-feeling, even as to a wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the King and Patrick had grown much attached to each
other, though the latter, being no lover of books, had wearied sorely
of the sojourn at Windsor, which the King himself only found endurable
by much study and reflection.&nbsp; Their only variety had been keeping
Christmas at Hertford with Queen Catherine; &lsquo;sorry pastime,&rsquo;
as Drummond reported it to him, though gladdened to the King by Joan
Beaufort&rsquo;s presence, in all her charms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Demoiselle of Luxemburg was there too, statelier than
ever,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is now at Middleham Castle,
with the Lady Montagu, and you might make it your way northward, and
lodge a night there.&nbsp; If you can win her consent, it were well
to be wedded when we are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never shall I, my lord.&nbsp; I should not dare even to speak
of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is well; but, Malcolm, you merit something from the damsel.&nbsp;
You are ten times the man you were when she flouted you.&nbsp; If women
were not mostly witless, you would be much to be preferred to any mere
Ajax or Fierabras; and if this damsel should have come to the wiser
mind that it were pity to be buried to the world&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, I pray you say no more.&nbsp; I were forsworn to ask
such a thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I bid you not, only I would I were there to see that all be
not lost for want of a word in season; and it is high time that something
be done.&nbsp; Here be letters from my Lord of Th&eacute;rouenne, demanding
the performance of the contract ere our return home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He cannot reach her here,&rsquo; said Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; but his outcry can reach your honour; and it were ill
to have such a house as that of Luxemburg crying out upon you for breach
of faith to their daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;That I should heed little, Sir.&nbsp;
I would fain bear something for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, this is mere sublimated devoir, too fine for our gross
understandings,&rsquo; said James, ironically.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mayhap the
sight of the soft roseate cheek may bring it somewhat down to poor human
flesh and blood once more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once I was tempted, Sir,&rsquo; said Malcolm, blushing deeply;
&lsquo;but did I not know that her holiness is the guardian of her earthly
beauty, I would not see her again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, there I command you,&rsquo; said the King; &lsquo;soon
I shall have subjects enough; but while I have but half a dozen, I cannot
be disobeyed by them!&nbsp; I bid you go to Middleham, and there I leave
all to the sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King spoke gaily, and with such kind good-humour that Malcolm,
humiliated by the thought of the past, durst not make fresh asseverations.&nbsp;
James, in the supreme moment of the pure and innocent romance of which
he was the hero, looked on love like his own as the highest crown of
human life, and distrusted the efforts after the superhuman which too
often were mere simulation or imitation; but a certain recollection
of Henry&rsquo;s warnings withheld him from pressing the matter, and
he returned to his own joys and hopes, looking on the struggles he expected
with a strong man&rsquo;s exulting joy, and not even counting the years
of his captivity wasted, though they had taken away his first youth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What should I have been,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;bred up in
the tumults at home?&nbsp; What could I have known better than Perth?&nbsp;
Nay, had I been sent home when I came to age, as a raw lad, how would
one or other by fraud or force have got the upper hand, so as I might
never have won it back.&nbsp; No, I would not have foregone one year
of study&mdash;far less that campaign in France, and the sight of Harry
in war and in policy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James also took Malcolm to see the child king, his little master.&nbsp;
This, the third king of James&rsquo;s captivity, was now a fair creature
of two years old.&nbsp; He trotted to meet his visitor, calling him
by a baby name for brother, and stretching out his arms to be lifted
up and fondled; for, as Dame Alice Boteller, his <i>gouvernante</i>,
muttered, he knew the King of Scots better than he did his own mother.</p>
<p>A retinue had been already collected, and equipments prepared, so
that there was no delay in sending forth Malcolm and Patrick upon their
northward journey.&nbsp; At the nearest town they halted, sending forward
a messenger to announce their neighbourhood to the old Countess of Salisbury
and her grand-daughter Lady Montagu, and to request permission to halt
for &lsquo;Mothering Sunday&rsquo; at the Castle.</p>
<p>In return a whole band of squires and retainers came forth, headed
by the knightly seneschal, to invite Lord Malcolm Stewart and his companion
to the Castle; whereupon Sir Patrick proceeded to don his gayest gown
and chaperon, and was greatly scandalized that Malcolm&rsquo;s preparation
consisted in putting on his black serge bachelor&rsquo;s gown and hood
of rabbit&rsquo;s fur such as he wore at Oxford, looking, as Patrick
declared, no better than a begging scholar.&nbsp; But Malcolm had made
up his mind that if he appeared before Esclairmonde at all it should
be in no other guise; and thus it was that he rode like a black spot
in the midst of the cavalcade, bright with the colours of Nevil and
of Montagu, and was marshalled up the broad stairs by the silver wand
of the seneschal.</p>
<p>Lord Montagu had gone back to the wars; so the family at home consisted
of the grand, stately, and distant old Countess of Salisbury, and her
young grand-daughter, the Lady Montagu, with her three months&rsquo;
old son.&nbsp; Each had an almost royal suite of well-born dames and
damsels in attendance, among whom the Demoiselle de Luxemburg alone
was on an equality with the mistresses of the house.&nbsp; Even Queen
Catherine&rsquo;s presence-chamber had hardly equalled the grand baronial
ceremony of the hall, where sat the three ladies in the midst of their
circle of attendants, male and female ranged on opposite sides; and
old Lady Salisbury knew the exact number of paces that it befitted her
and Lady Montagu to advance to receive the royal infusion of blood that
flowed in the veins of my Lord of Glenuskie.&nbsp; And yet it was the
cheek, and not the hand, that were offered in salutation by both ladies,
as well as by Esclairmonde.&nbsp; Malcolm, however, only durst kneel
on one knee and salute her hand, and felt himself burning with crimson
as the touch and voice brought back those longings that, as James had
said, proved him human still.&nbsp; He was almost glad that etiquette
required him to hand the aged Countess to her seat and to devote his
chief attention to her.</p>
<p>Punctilio reigned supreme in such a house as this.&nbsp; Nowhere
had Malcolm seen such observance of ceremony, save in the court of the
Duke of Burgundy, and there it was modified by the presence of rough
and ready warriors; but an ancient dame like Lady Salisbury thought
it both the due and the safeguard of her son&rsquo;s honour, and exacted
it rigorously of all who approached her.</p>
<p>Alice of Montagu had the sweet fragile look of a young mother about
her, but her frightened fawn air was gone; she was in her home, had
found her place, and held it with a simple dignity of her own, quite
ready to ripen into all the matronly authority, without the severe formality,
of her grand-dame.</p>
<p>She treated Malcolm with a gentle smiling courtesy such as she had
never vouchsafed to him before, and all the shyness that had once made
her silent was gone, when at the supper-table, and afterwards seated
around the fire, the tidings of the camp and court were talked over
with all the zest of those to whom King Harry&rsquo;s last campaign
was becoming &lsquo;old times&rsquo;; and what with her husband&rsquo;s
letters and opinions, little Alice was really the best-informed as to
the present state of things.&nbsp; Esclairmonde took her part in the
conversation, but there was no opportunity of exchanging a private or
personal word between her and Malcolm in a party of five, where one
was as vigilant and grave-eyed as my Lady Salisbury.</p>
<p>However, the next was a peculiar day, the Fourth Sunday in Lent,
called &lsquo;Mothering Sunday&rsquo; because on that day it was originally
the custom for offerings to be carried from all the country round to
the cathedral or mother church on that day.&nbsp; This custom had been
modified, but it was still the rule that all the persons, who at other
times worshipped at the nearest monastery chapel or at a private chapel
in their own houses, should on that day repair to their parish church,
and there make a special offering at the Mass&mdash;that offering which
has since become the Easter dues.&nbsp; It was a festival Sunday too&mdash;&lsquo;Refreshing
Sunday&rsquo;&mdash;then, as now, marked by the Gospel on the feeding
of the multitude; and from this, as well as from the name, the pretty
custom had begun of offering the mother of each house her rich simnal
cake, with some other gift from each of her children.</p>
<p>Hearing a pattering of feet in the early morning, Malcolm looked
out and beheld a whole troop of small children popping in and out of
a low archway.&nbsp; If he could have peeped in, he would have known
how many simnals Ladies Esclairmonde and Alice were sending down&mdash;with
something more substantial&mdash;to be given to mothers by the children
who as yet had nothing to bring of their own.</p>
<p>But when the household assembled in the castle hall, they did see
fair young Lady Montagu kneel at the chair of the grave old Countess,
and hold up a silver dish, wherein lay the simnal, mixed, kneaded, and
moulded by her own hands, and bearing on it a rich ruby clasp, sent
by her father, the Earl, as his special gift to his mother on this Sunday.</p>
<p>And then, when the old lady, with glistening eyes, had spoken her
blessing on the fair young head bent down before her, and the grandchild
rose up, there was the pretty surprise for her of her little swaddled
son, lying in Esclairmonde&rsquo;s arms, and between the small fingers,
that as yet knew not how to grasp, the tiny simnal; and moreover a fair
pearl devised in like manner by the absent Sir Richard as a gift for
his wife&rsquo;s first &lsquo;Mothering Sunday.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was
no etiquette here to hinder sweet Alice from passionately clasping her
child, and covering him with kisses, as many for his father as for himself,
as she laughed at the baby smiles and helpless gestures of the future
king-maker, whose ambition and turbulence were to be the ruin of that
fair and prosperous household, and bring the gentle Alice to a widowed,
bereaved, and attainted old age.</p>
<p>Well that none there present saw the future, as she proudly claimed
the admiration of Malcolm for her babe!</p>
<p>She was equipped for the expedition to the parish church, as likewise
were Esclairmonde and almost all the rest; but the aged Countess could
not encounter the cold March winds, and had a dispensation; and thus
Alice, being the lady of the procession, contrived at the same time
to call Sir Patrick to her side, and bid Lord Malcolm lead the Lady
Esclairmonde.</p>
<p>For as the weather was dry and cold, Lady Montagu had chosen to go
on foot; and a grand procession it was that she led, of gentlemen and
ladies, two and two, in their bright dresses and adornments that delighted
the eyes of the homely yeomen and their wives, flocking in from their
homesteads with baskets of offerings, often in kind.</p>
<p>Meantime, Malcolm, holding the tips of Esclairmonde&rsquo;s fingers,
durst not speak till she began: &lsquo;This is a devout and pious household&mdash;full
of peace and good government.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And your time goes happily here?&rsquo; asked Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it has been a peaceful harbour wherein to wait,&rsquo;
said Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;And even if Alice were called to her
husband in France, my Lady Countess will keep me with her till there
be a vacancy for me at St. Katharine&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you the promise from Queen Joan?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Esclairmonde.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Countess
had been a lady of hers, and wrought with her, so that whenever the
post of bedeswoman is in her gift I shall be preferred to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You, the heiress, accept the charity!&rsquo; Malcolm could
not help exclaiming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The better for all remnants of pride,&rsquo; returned the
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you, my lord, has it fared well with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm, happy in her interest, poured forth all that he had to tell,
and she listened as Esclairmonde alone could listen.&nbsp; There was
something in her very expression of attention that seemed to make the
speaker take out the alloy and leave only his purest gold to meet her
ears.&nbsp; Malcolm forgot those throbs of foolish wild hope that had
shot across him like demon temptations to hermit saints, and only felt
that the creature of his love and reverence was listening benignly as
he told her of the exceeding delight that he was unravelling in learned
lore; how each step showed him further heights, and how he had come
to view the Light of the World as the light of wisdom, to the research
of which he meant to devote his entire life, among universities and
manuscripts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Light of Wisdom,&rsquo; repeated Esclairmonde&mdash;&lsquo;so
it may be, for Christ is Heavenly Wisdom; but I doubt me if the Light
of the World lies solely in books and universities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Once I was fool enough
to fancy it was the light of glory, calling knights to deeds of fame
and chivalry.&nbsp; I have seen mine error now, and&mdash;oh, lady,
what mean you? where should that light be, save in the writings of wise
and holy men?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Methinks,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, &lsquo;that the light
is there, even as the light is also before the eyes of the true knight;
but it is not only there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is it then?&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;In helmet
or in cowl, I am the sworn champion of the Light of the World.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Light,&rsquo; said Esclairmonde, looking upwards, &lsquo;the
true Light of the World is the Blessed Saviour, the Heavenly Wisdom
of God; and His champions find Him and serve Him in camp, cloister,
or school, or wherever He has marked their path, so as they seek not
their own profit or glory, and lay not up their treasure for themselves
on earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then surely,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;the hoards of deep
study within the mind are treasures beyond the earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your schoolmen speak of spirit, mind, and body,&rsquo; said
Esclairmonde&mdash;&lsquo;at least so I, an ignorant woman, have been
told.&nbsp; Should not the true Light for eternity lighten the spirit
rather than the mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm pondered and said: &lsquo;I thought I had found the right
path at last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay&mdash;never, never did I say otherwise,&rsquo; cried Esclairmonde.&nbsp;
&lsquo;To seek God&rsquo;s Light in good men&rsquo;s words, and pursue
it, must be a blessed task.&nbsp; Every task must be blessed to which
He leads.&nbsp; And when you are enlightened with that light, you will
hold it up to others.&nbsp; When you have found the treasure, you will
scatter it here, and so lay it up above.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Esclairmonde&rsquo;s words were almost a riddle to Malcolm, but his
reverence for her made him lay them up deeply, as he watched her kneeling
at the Mass, her upturned face beaming with an angelic expression.</p>
<p>His mind was much calmed by this meeting.&nbsp; It had had an absolutely
contrary effect to what King James had expected, by spiritualizing his
love, and increasing that reverence which cast out its earthliness.&nbsp;
That first throb which had been so keen at meeting, and knowing her
not for him, had passed away in the refining of that distant worship
he had paid her in those days of innocence.</p>
<p>Lady Montagu was quite satisfied with him now.&nbsp; He was the Malcolm
of her first acquaintance, only without his foolish diffidence, and
with a weight and earnestness that made him a man and not a boy; and
she cordially invited him to bring his sister with him, and rest, on
the way southward.&nbsp; He agreed most thankfully, since this would
be the only opportunity of showing Esclairmonde and Lilias one to the
other, as well as one of his own few chances of seeing Esclairmonde.</p>
<p>Once they must meet, that their promises might be restored the one
to the other; but as the betrothal remained the lady&rsquo;s security,
this could not be done till she became pledged at St. Katharine&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
When the opportunity came, she was to send Malcolm a messenger, and
he would come to her at once.&nbsp; Until then he promised that he would
not leave Great Britain.</p>
<p>On Monday the cousins proceeded, coming after a time to the route
by which Malcolm had ridden three years before, and where he was now
at home in comparison with Patrick.&nbsp; How redolent it was with recollections
of King Harry, in all his gaiety and grace, ere the shock of his brother&rsquo;s
death had fallen on him!&nbsp; At Thirsk, Malcolm told of the prowess
and the knighthood of honest Trenton and Kitson, to somewhat incredulous
ears.&nbsp; The two squires had been held as clownish fellows, and the
sentiment of the country was that Mistress Agnes was well quit of them,
and the rough guardianship by which they had kept off all other suitors.&nbsp;
As mine host concluded, &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a fine thing to go to the
wars.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hearing that Kitson&rsquo;s mother lived not a mile out of his way,
Malcolm rode to the fine old moated grange, where he found her sitting
at her spinning, presiding over a great plentiful household, while her
second son, a much shrewder-looking man than Sir Christopher, managed
the farm.</p>
<p>The travellers were welcomed with eager hospitality so soon as it
was understood that they brought tidings of &lsquo;our Kit&rsquo;; and
Malcolm&rsquo;s story was listened to with tears of joy by the old lady,
while the brother could not get over his amazement at hearing that Trenton
and Kitson had become a proverb in the camp for oneness in friendship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Made it up with Will Trenton!&nbsp; And never fought it out!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d never know our Kit again after that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His steady bravery, his knighthood, and the King&rsquo;s praise,
his having assisted in saving Lord Glenuskie&rsquo;s life against such
odds, did not seem to strike Wilfred Kitson half as much as the friendship
with Trenton, and Malcolm did not think the regret was very great at
the two knights having given up their intention of returning.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Our Kit&rsquo;s&rsquo; place seemed to have closed up behind
him; Wilfred seemed to be too much master to be ready to give up to
the elder brother; and even the mother had learnt to do without him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant,&rsquo; quoth she, &lsquo;that now he is a
knight and got used to fine French ways, he&rsquo;ll think nothing good
enow for him.&nbsp; And if he brought Will Trenton with him, I&rsquo;d
not sit at the board with the fellow.&mdash;But ye&rsquo;ll ride over,
Wilfred, and take care the minx Agnes knows what she&rsquo;s lost.&nbsp;
Ay, and if you knew of a safe hand, Sir, when the shearing is over I&rsquo;d
send the lad a purse of nobles to keep up his knighthood in the camp,
forsooth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certes,&rsquo; said Malcolm, as after a salt-fish dinner he
mounted again, &lsquo;if honest Kitson knew, he would scarce turn back
from the camp, where he is somebody.&nbsp; Shall we find ourselves as
little wanted when we get home, Patie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Patrick drew himself up with a happy face of secret assurance.&nbsp;
Nothing could make Lilias forsake him, he well knew.</p>
<p>At Durham they found their good friend Father Akefield, erst Prior
of Coldingham, but who had been violently dispossessed by the House
of Albany in favour of their candidate, Drax, about a year before, and
was thankful to have been allowed with a few English monks to retire
across the Border to the mother Abbey at Durham.</p>
<p>The good father could hardly believe his eyes when he beheld Malcolm,
now a comely and personable young gentleman, less handsome and graceful
indeed than many, but with all his painful personal peculiarities gone,
with none of the scared, imploring look, but with a grave thoughtful
earnestness about his face, as though all that once was timid and wandering
was now fixed and steadfast.</p>
<p>Father Akefield could tell nothing of Lilias since his own expulsion,
but as the Prioress of St. Abbs was herself a Drummond, and no one durst
interfere with her, he had no alarms for her safety.&nbsp; But he advised
the two gentlemen to go straight to St. Abbs, without showing themselves
at Coldingham, lest Prior Drax, being in the Albany interest, should
make any demur at giving her up to the care of the brother, who still
wanted some months of his twenty-first year.</p>
<p>Accordingly they pushed on, and in due time slept at Berwick, receiving
civilities from the English governor that chafed Patrick&rsquo;s blood,
which became inflammable as soon as he neared the Border; and rising
early the next morning, they passed the gates, and were on Scottish
ground once more, their hearts bounding at the sense that it was their
own land, and would soon be no more a land of misrule.&nbsp; With their
knowledge of King James and his intentions, well might they have unlimited
hopes for the country over which he was about to reign.</p>
<p>They turned aside from Coldingham, and made for the sea, and at length
the promontory of St. Abbs Head rose before them; they passed through
the outer buildings intended as shelter for the attendants of ladies
coming to the nunnery, and knocked at the gateway.</p>
<p>A wicket in the door was opened, and the portress looked out through
a grating.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Benedicite</i>, good Sister,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Prithee tell the Mother Abbess that Malcolm Stewart of Glenuskie
is here from the King, and craves to speak with her and the Lady Lilias.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Malcolm!&nbsp; Lady Lilias!&nbsp; St. Ebba&rsquo;s good
mercy!&rsquo; shrieked the affrighted portress.&nbsp; They heard her
rushing headlong across the court, and looked on one another in consternation.</p>
<p>Patrick betook himself to knocking as if he would beat down the door,
and Malcolm leant against it with a foreboding that took away his breath&mdash;dreading
the moment when it should be opened.</p>
<p>The portress and her keys returned again, and parleyed a moment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are the Lord Malcolm in very deed&mdash;in the flesh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wherefore not?&rsquo; demanded Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, but we heard ye were slain, my lord,&rsquo; explained
the portress&mdash;letting him in, however, and leading them across
the court, to where the Mother Abbess, Annabel Drummond, awaited them
in the parlour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas, Sirs, what grievous error has this been?&rsquo; was
her exclamation; while Malcolm, scarcely waiting for salutation, demanded,
&lsquo;Where is my sister?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&nbsp; In St. Hilda&rsquo;s keeping at Whitby, whither
the King sent for her,&rsquo; said the Abbess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The King!&rsquo; cried Malcolm, &lsquo;we come from the King!&nbsp;
Oh, what treachery has been here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, Lord Malcolm&mdash;and you, my kinsman, Sir Patrick
of the Braes, how do I see you here?&nbsp; We had heard you both were
dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You heard a lying tale then, good Mother,&rsquo; said Patrick,
gruffly, &lsquo;no doubt devised for the misery of the&mdash;of my&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
He could not finish the sentence, and Malcolm entreated the Abbess to
tell the whole.</p>
<p>It appeared that about a year previously the chaplain of the monastery
had learnt at Coldingham that Sir John Swinton of Swinton had sent home
tidings that Patrick Drummond had been thrown from his horse and left
behind in a village which the English had harried, and as he could not
move, he was sure to have been either burnt or hung.&nbsp; This conclusion
was natural, and argued no malice in the reporter; and while poor Lilias
was still in her first agony of grief, Prior Drax sent over intelligence
derived from the Duke of Albany himself that Malcolm Stewart of Glenuskie
had been stabbed in the forest of Vincennes.&nbsp; This report Malcolm
himself accounted for.&nbsp; He had heard a Scots tongue among his foes,
though national feeling had made him utterly silent on that head to
the Duke of Bedford, and he guessed it to belong to a certain M&rsquo;Kay,
whose clan regarded themselves as at feud with the Stewarts, and of
whom he had heard as living a wild <i>routier</i> life.&nbsp; He had
probably been hired by Ghisbert for the attack, and had returned home
and spread the report of its success.</p>
<p>Some few weeks later, the Abbess Annabel continued, there had arrived
two monks from Coldingham, with an escort, declaring themselves to have
received orders from King James to transport the Lady Lilias to the
nunnery at Whitby, where the Abbess had promised to receive her, till
he could determine her fate.</p>
<p>The forlorn and desolate Lilias, believing herself to stand alone
in the world, was very loth to quit her shelter and her friends at St.
Abbs; but the Abbess, doubting her own ability to protect her from the
rapacious grasp of Walter Stewart, now that she had, as she believed,
become an heiress, and glad to avert from her house the persecution
that such protection would bring upon it, had gratefully heard of this
act of consideration on the King&rsquo;s part, and expedited her departure.&nbsp;
The two monks, Simon Bell and Ringan Johnstone, had not returned to
the monastery, but had been thought to be in the parent house at Durham;
but Malcolm, who knew Brother Simon by sight, was clear that he had
not seen him there.</p>
<p>All this had taken place a year ago, and there could be no doubt
that some treachery had been exercised.&nbsp; Nothing had since been
heard of Lilias; none of Malcolm&rsquo;s letters had reached St. Abbs,
having doubtless been suppressed by the Prior of Coldingham; and all
that was certain was that Walter Stewart, to whom their first suspicions
directed themselves, had not publicly avouched any marriage with Lilias
or claimed the Glenuskie estates, or the King, who had of late been
in close correspondence with Scotland, must have heard of it.&nbsp;
And it was also hardly possible that the Regent Murdoch and his sons,
though they might for a few weeks have been misled by M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s
report, should not have soon become aware of Malcolm&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>Unless, then, Walter had married her &lsquo;on the first brash,&rsquo;
as Patrick called it, he might not have thought her a prize worth the
winning; but the whole aspect of affairs had become most alarming, and
Malcolm turned pale as death at the thought that his sister might be
suffering retribution for the sin he had contemplated.</p>
<p>The danger was terrible!&nbsp; He could not imagine Lilias to have
the moral grandeur and force of Esclairmonde.&nbsp; Moreover, she supposed
her lover dead, and had not the same motive for guarding her troth.&nbsp;
Forlorn and despairing, she might have yielded, and Walter Stewart was,
Malcolm verily believed, worse to deal with than even Bo&euml;mond.&nbsp;
As the whole danger and uncertainty came over him, his senses seemed
to reel; he leant back in his seat, and heard as in the midst of a dream
his sister&rsquo;s sobs and groans, Patrick&rsquo;s fierce and furious
exclamations, and the Abbess&rsquo;s attempts at consoling him.&nbsp;
Dizzy with horror at the scene he realized, Lilias&rsquo;s cries and
shrieks of entreaty were ringing in his ear, when suddenly a sweet full
low voice seemed to come through them, &lsquo;I am bound ever to pray
for you and your sister.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mingled with the cry came ever
the sweet soft Litany cadences&mdash;&lsquo;For all that are desolate
and oppressed: we beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord.&rsquo; Gradually
the cries seemed to be swallowed up, both voices blended in <i>Kyrie
eleison</i> and then in the <i>Gloria</i>, and at that moment he became
aware of Patrick crying, &lsquo;I will seek her in every castle in Scotland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay, Patrick,&rsquo; he said, rising, though forced to hold
by his chair; &lsquo;that must be my part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&mdash;why, the laddie is white as a sheet!&nbsp; He well-nigh
swooned at the tidings.&nbsp; You seek her, forsooth!&rsquo; and Patrick
laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Patie,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;for this I am strong.&nbsp;
It is my duty and not yours, and God will strengthen me for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Patrick burst out at this: &lsquo;Neither man nor devil shall tell
me it is not mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are the King&rsquo;s prisoner still,&rsquo; said Malcolm,
rising to energy; &lsquo;you are bound to return to him.&nbsp; The tidings
must be taken to him at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A groom could do that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither so swiftly nor surely as you.&nbsp; Moreover, your
word of honour binds you not to wander at your own pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My honour binds me not to trust you&mdash;wee Malcolm&mdash;to
wander into the wolf&rsquo;s cage alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not the silly feckless callant I once was, Patie,&rsquo;
answered Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are many places where my student&rsquo;s
serge gown will take me safely, where your corslet and lance would never
find entrance.&nbsp; No one will know me again as I am now: will they,
holy Mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Assuredly not,&rsquo; said the Abbess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A student is too mean a prey to be meddled with,&rsquo; proceeded
Malcolm, &lsquo;and is sure of hospitality in castle or convent.&nbsp;
I can try at Coldingham to find out whither the two monks are gone,
and then follow up the track.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Patrick stormed at the plan, and was most unwilling it should be
adopted.&nbsp; He at least must follow, and keep watch over his young
cousin, or it would be a mere throwing the helve after the hatchet&mdash;a
betrayal of his trust.</p>
<p>But a little reflection convinced him that thus to follow would only
bring suspicion on Malcolm and defeat his plans; and that it were better
to obtain some certain information ere the King should come home, and
have to interfere with a high hand; and Malcolm&rsquo;s arguments about
his obligations as a captive, too, had their effect.&nbsp; He perceived
his own incapacity to act; and in his despair at nothing being done
consented to risk Malcolm in the search, while he himself should proceed
to the King, only ascertaining on the way that Lilias was not at Whitby.&nbsp;
And so, in grief and anxiety, the cousins parted, and Malcolm alone
durst speak a word of hope.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII: THE BEGGING SCHOLAR</h2>
<p>&lsquo;The poor scholar,&rsquo; now only existing in Ireland and
Brittany&mdash;nay, we believe extinct there since the schoolmaster
has become not abroad, but at home, in Government colleges&mdash;was
to be found throughout the commonwealth of Europe in the Middle Ages.&nbsp;
Young lads, in whom convent schools had developed a thirst for learning,
could only gratify it by making their way to some university, where
between begging, singing, teaching, receiving doles, earning rewards
in encounters of wit and learning, doing menial services and using all
manner of shifts, they contrived to live a hard life, half savage on
the one side, highly intellectual upon the other.&nbsp; They would suck
the marrow of one university, and then migrate to another; and the rank
they had gained in the first was available in the second, so that it
was no means uncommon for them to bring away degrees from half the universities
in Europe, all of which formed one general system&mdash;all were like
islands of one country, whose common language was queer Latin, and whose
terms, manners, and customs were alike in all main points.</p>
<p>Scotland contributed many of her sons to this curious race of vagabond
students, when she herself was without any university to satisfy the
cravings of her thoughtful and intellectual people.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
country without a Scot or a flea&rsquo; was an uncomplimentary proverb
due to the numerous young clerks, equally fierce for frays and for lectures,
who flocked to the seats of learning on the Continent, and sometimes
became naturalized there, sometimes came home again, to fight their
way to the higher benefices of the Church, or to become councillors
of state.</p>
<p>It was true that Malcolm was an Oxford scholar, or rather bachelor,
and that Oxford and Cambridge were almost the only universities where
Scots were not&mdash;their place being taken by multitudinous Irish;
yet not only were all universities alike in essentials, but he had seen
and heard enough of that at Paris to be able to personate a clerk from
thence.</p>
<p>It was no small plunge for one hitherto watched, tended, and guarded
as Malcolm had been, to set forth entirely alone; but as he had approached
manhood, and strengthened in body, his spirit had gained much in courage,
and the anxiety about his sister swallowed up all other considerations.&nbsp;
Even while he entreated the prayers of the Abbess, he felt quite sure
that he had those of Esclairmonde; and when he had hunted out of his
mails the plain bachelor&rsquo;s rabbit-skin hood and black gown&mdash;which,
perhaps, was a little too fine in texture for the poor wanderer&mdash;and
fastened on his back, with a leathern thong, a package containing a
few books and a change of linen, his pale and intellectual face made
him look so entirely the young clerk, that Patrick hardly believed it
was Malcolm.</p>
<p>And when the roads parted, and Drummond and his escort had to turn
towards Berwick, while Malcolm took the path to the monastery, it was
the younger who was the stronger and more resolute of the two; for Patrick
could neither reconcile himself to peril the boy, who had always been
his anxious trust, nor to return to the King without him; and yet no
one who loved Lilias could withhold him from his quest.</p>
<p>Malcolm did not immediately speed to the monastery on taking leave
of Patrick.&nbsp; He stood first to watch the armour flashes gradually
die away, and the little troop grow smaller to his eye, across the brown
moor, till they were entirely out of sight, and he himself left alone.&nbsp;
Then he knelt by a bush of gorse, told his beads, and earnestly entreated
direction and aid for himself, and protection for his sister; and when
the sun grew so low as to make it time for a wanderer to seek harbour,
he stained and daggled his gown in the mire and water of a peat-moss,
so as to destroy its Oxford gloss, took a book in his hand, and walked
towards the monastery, reciting Latin verses in the sing-song tone then
universally followed.</p>
<p>As he came among the fields, he saw that the peasants, and lay brethren
who had been working among them, were returning, some from sowing, others
from herding the cattle, which they drove before them to the byre within
the protecting wall of the monastery.</p>
<p>A monk&mdash;with a weather-beaten face and athletic figure, much
like a farmer&rsquo;s of the present day&mdash;overtook him, and hailed
him with &lsquo;<i>Benedicite</i>, you there and welcome to your clerkship!&nbsp;
Are you coming for supper and bed in the convent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm knew good-natured Brother Nicolas, and kept his hood well
over his face after the first salutation; though he felt confident that
Lord Malcolm could hardly be recognized in the begging scholar, as he
made reply, &lsquo;<i>Salve, reverende frater.&nbsp; Venio de Luteti&acirc;
Parisiorum</i>.&rsquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Whisht with your Latin, laddie,&rsquo; said the brother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Speak out, if you&rsquo;ve a Scots tongue in your head, and have
not left it in foreign parts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For bed and board, holy father, I shall be most thankful,&rsquo;
replied Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s more like it,&rsquo; said the brother, who acted
as a kind of farming steward, and was a hearty, good-natured gossip.&nbsp;
&lsquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the name of ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He gave his real Christian name; and added that he came from Glenuskie,
where the good Tutor of Glenuskie had been kind enough to notice him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Brother Nicolas, &lsquo;he was a guid man
to all towardly youths.&nbsp; He died in this house, more&rsquo;s the
pity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, Sir&mdash;so I heard say,&rsquo; returned Malcolm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He was a good friend to me!&rsquo; he added, to cover his heavy
sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;And, Sir, how went it with the young laird and leddy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the young laird&mdash;a feckless, ugsome, sickly wean
he was, puir laddie&mdash;a knight cam by, an&rsquo; behoved to take
him to the King.&nbsp; Nay, but if you&rsquo;ve been at Parish&mdash;if
that&rsquo;s what ye mean with your Lutetia&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll have seen
him an&rsquo; the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw the King,&rsquo; answered Malcolm; &lsquo;but among
the Englishry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sorry sight enow!&rsquo; said the monk; &lsquo;but he&rsquo;ll
soon find his Scots heart again; and here we&rsquo;ve got rid of the
English leaven from the house, and be all sound and leal Scots here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the lady?&rsquo; Malcolm ventured to ask.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
had a winsome face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho! ho! what have young clerks to do wi&rsquo; winsome faces?&rsquo;
laughed the Benedictine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was good to me,&rsquo; Malcolm could truly say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They had her in St. Abbs yonder,&rsquo; said the monk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she there?&rsquo; asked Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would pay
my duty and thanks to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now&mdash;there I cannot say,&rsquo; replied Brother Nicolas.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My good Mother Abbess and our Prior are not the friends they
were in Prior Akefield&rsquo;s time; and there&rsquo;s less coming and
going between the houses.&nbsp; There was a noise that Lord Malcolm
had been slain, and I did hear that, thereupon, she had been claimed
as a ward of the Crown.&nbsp; But I cannot say.&nbsp; If ye gang to
St. Abbs the morn, ye may hear if she be there&mdash;and at any rate
get the dole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was clear that the good brother knew no more, and Malcolm could
only thank him for his condescension, and follow among the herdsmen
into the well-known monastery court.</p>
<p>Here he availed himself of his avowed connection with Glenuskie,
to beg to be shown good old Sir David Drummond&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp;
A flat gray stone in the porch was pointed out to him; and beside this
he knelt, until the monks flocked in for prayers&mdash;which were but
carelessly and hurriedly sung; and then followed supper.&nbsp; It was
all so natural to him, that it was with an effort that he recalled that
his place was not at the high table, as Lord Malcolm Stewart, but that
Malcolm, the nameless begging scholar, must be trencher-fellow with
the servants and lay brethren.&nbsp; He was the less concerned, that
here there was less danger of recognition, and more freedom of conversation.</p>
<p>Things were evidently much altered.&nbsp; A novice was indeed, as
usual, placed aloft in the refectory pulpit, to read aloud to the brethren
during their repast, but no one seemed to think it needful to preserve
the decorous silence that had been rigidly exacted during Prior Akefield&rsquo;s
time, and there was a continual buzz of conversation.&nbsp; Lent though
it was, the fish was of the most esteemed kinds, and it was evident
that, like the monks of Melrose, they &lsquo;made gude kale.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Few of the kindly old faces that Malcolm remembered were to be seen
under their cowls.&nbsp; Prior Drax himself had much more the countenance
of a moss-trooper than of a monk&mdash;mayhap he was then meditating
that which he afterwards carried out successfully, <i>i.e</i>. the capture
and appropriation of a whole instalment of King James&rsquo;s ransom,
on its way across the Border; and there was a rude recklessness and
self-indulgence about the looks, voices, and manners of the brethren
he had brought with him, such as made Malcolm feel that if he had had
his wish, and remained at Coldingham, he should soon have found it no
haven of peace.</p>
<p>The lay-brothers and old servants were fixtures, but the old faithful
and devout ones looked forlorn and unhappy and there had been a great
importation of the ruffianly men-at-arms, whom the more pugnacious ecclesiastics,
as well as nobles, of Scotland, were apt to maintain.&nbsp; Guards there
had been in old times, but kept under strict discipline; whereas, in
the rude conduct of these men, there was no sign that they knew themselves
to be in a religious house.&nbsp; Malcolm, keeping aloof from these
as much as might be, gave such an account of himself as was most consistent
with truth, since it was necessary to account for his returning so young
from his studies.&nbsp; He had, he said, been told that there was an
inheritance fallen due to him, and that the kinsman, in whose charge
his sister had been left, was dead; and he had come home to seek her
out, and inquire into the matter of his heirship.</p>
<p>Rude jokes, from some of the new denizens of the monastery, were
spent on the improbability of his finding sister or lands; if it were
in the Barony of Glenuskie, the House of Albany had taken the administration
of that into their own hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay&mdash;but,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;could I but see
my young Lady Lilias, she might make suit for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gray-headed lay-brother, to whom he addressed himself, replied
that it was little the Lady Lilias could do, but directed him to St.
Abbs to find her; whereat one of the men-at-arms burst out laughing,
and crying, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a&rsquo; that ye ken, auld Davie!&nbsp;
As though the Master of Albany would let a bonnie lassie ware hersel&rsquo;
and her tocher on stone walls and dour old nuns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has she wedded the Master of Albany, then?&rsquo; asked Malcolm,
concealing his anxiety as best he might.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s as he pleases; and by my troth he took pains
enow to get her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What pains?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, once she slipped out of his very fingers; that time that
he had laid hands on her, and the hirpling doited brother of hers cam
down with a strange knight, put her into St. Abbs, and made off for
England&mdash;so they said.&nbsp; Some of the rogues would have it &rsquo;twas
St. Andrew in bodily shape, and that he tirled the young laird, as was
only fit for a saint, aff to heaven wi&rsquo; him; for he was no more
seen in these parts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, that couldna be,&rsquo; put in another soldier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sandy M&rsquo;Kay took his aith that he was in the English camp&mdash;more
shame till him&mdash;an&rsquo; was stickit dead for meddling between
King Harry&rsquo;s brother and his luve.&nbsp; It sorted him weel, I
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aweel!&rsquo; continued the first; &lsquo;gane is he, and
sma&rsquo; loss wi&rsquo; him!&nbsp; An&rsquo; yon old beldame over
at St. Abbs, she kens weel how to keep a lass wi&rsquo; a tocher&mdash;so
what does the Master but sends a letter ower to our Prior, bidding him
send two trusty brethren, as though from the King, to conduct her to
Whitby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Malcolm; &lsquo;but that&rsquo;s ower the
Border.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even so; but the Glenuskies are all English at heart, and
it sicker trained away the silly lassie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then?&rsquo;&mdash;the other man-at-arms laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, at the first hostelry, ye can guess what sort of nuns
were ready to meet her!&nbsp; I promise ye she skirled, and ca&rsquo;ed
Heaven and earth to help; but Brother Simon and Brother Ringan gave
their word they&rsquo;d see nae ill dune to her, and she rade with them
on each side of her, and us tall fellows behind and before, till we
cam to Doune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what became of her, the poor lassie, then?&rsquo; inquired
Malcolm, steadying his voice with much effort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye maun ask the Master that,&rsquo; said the soldier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I ken nae mair; I was sent on anither little errand of the Earl
of Fife into the Highlands, and only cam back hither a week syne, to
watch the Border.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had it been St. Andrew that saved her before, he wad hae come
again,&rsquo; pondered the lay-brother.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;d hardly
hae given her up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Weel, I heard the lassie cry on the Master to mind the aith
he had made the former time; an&rsquo; though he tried to laugh her
to scorn, his eyes grew wild, and there were some that tell&rsquo;d
me they lookit to see that glittering awsome knight among them again!&nbsp;
My certie, they maun hae been feared enow the time he did come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm had now had his fears and suspicions so far confirmed, that
he perceived what his course should next be.&nbsp; Strange to say, in
spite of the horror of knowing his sister to have been a whole year
in Walter Stewart&rsquo;s power, he was neither hopeless nor disheartened.&nbsp;
Lilias seemed to have kept her persecutor at bay once, and she might
have done so again&mdash;if only by the appeal to the mysterious relic,
on which his oath to abstain from violence had been sworn.&nbsp; And
confidence in Esclairmonde&rsquo;s prayers continued to buoy him up,
as he recited his own, and formed his designs for ascertaining whether
she were to be found at Doune&mdash;either as wife, or as captive, to
Walter, Earl of Fife and heir of Albany.</p>
<p>So soon as the doors of Coldingham Priory were opened, he was on
his way northward.&nbsp; It was a sore and trying journey, in the bitter
March weather, for one so little used to hardship.&nbsp; He did not
fail in obtaining shelter or food; his garb was everywhere a passport;
but he grew weary and footsore, and his anxiety greatly increased when
he found that fatigue was bringing back the lameness, which greatly
enhanced the likelihood of his being recognized.&nbsp; Kind monks, and
friendly gude-wives, hospitably persuaded the worn student to remain
and rest, till his blistered feet were whole; but he pressed on whenever
he found it possible to travel, and after the first week found his progress
less tardy and painful.</p>
<p>Resting at Edinburgh for Passion-tide and Easter Day, he found that
the Regent Albany himself, with all his family, were at Doune, and he
accordingly made his way thither; rejoicing that he had had some little
time to perfect himself in his part, before rehearsing it to the persons
most likely to detect his disguise.</p>
<p>Along the banks and braes of bonny Doune he slowly moved, with weary
limbs; looking up to the huge pile of the majestic castle in sickening
of heart at the doubt that was about to become a certainty, and that
involved the happiness or the absolute misery of his sister&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; Nay, he would almost have preferred to find that she had
perished in her resistance, rather than have become wife to such a man
as Walter Stewart.</p>
<p>The Duke of Albany, as representing majesty, kept up all the state
that Scottish majesty was capable of, in its impoverished irregular
state.&nbsp; Hosts of rough lawless warriors, men-at-arms, squires and
knights, lived at free quarters, in a sort of rude plenty, in and about
the Castle; eating and drinking at the Regent&rsquo;s expense, sleeping
where they could, in hall or stable, and for clothing and armour trusting
to &lsquo;spulzie&rsquo;; always ready for violence, without much caring
on whom exercised&mdash;otherwise hunting, or lounging, or swelling
their master&rsquo;s disorderly train.</p>
<p>This retinue was almost at its largest at this time, being swelled
by the following of the two younger sons of Murdoch, Robert and Alexander;
and the courts of the Castle were filled with rude, savage-looking men,
some few grooming horses, others with nothing to do but to shout forth
their jeers at the pale, black-gowned student, who timidly limped into
their lair.</p>
<p>Timidly&mdash;yes; for the awful chances heavily oppressed him; and
the horrible scurrility and savagery that greeted him on all sides made
his heart faint at the thought of his Lily in this cage of foul animals.&nbsp;
He did not fear for himself, and never paused until a shouting circle
of idle ruffians set themselves full in his way, to badger and bait
the poor scholar with taunts and insults&mdash;hemming him in, bawling
out ribald mirth, as a pack of hounds fall on some stray dog, or, as
Malcolm thought, in a moment half of sick horror, half of resolute resignation,
like wild cattle&mdash;fat bulls of Bashan closing in on every side.&nbsp;
So horrible a moment of distress he had never known; but suddenly, as
he stood summoning all his strength, panting with dismay, inwardly praying,
and trying to close his ears and commend himself to One who knew what
mockery is, there was an opening of the crowd, a youth darted down among
them, with a loud cry of &lsquo;Shame!&nbsp; Out on you!&nbsp; A poor
scholar!&rsquo; and taking Malcolm&rsquo;s hand, led him forward; while
a laugh of mockery rose in the distance&mdash;&lsquo;Like to like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, my friend and brother, I am Baccalaureus, even as you
are,&rsquo; eagerly said the young gentleman, in whom Malcolm, somewhat
to his alarm, recognized his cousin, James Kennedy, the King&rsquo;s
nephew, a real Parisian &lsquo;<i>bejanus</i>,&rsquo; or <i>bec jaune</i>,
<a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a> when they last
had met in the H&ocirc;tel de St. Pol; and thus not only qualified to
confute and expose him, should he show any ignorance of details, but
also much more likely to know him than those who had not seen him for
many months before he had left Scotland.</p>
<p>But James Kennedy asked no questions, only said kindly, in the Latin
that was always spoken in the University, &lsquo;Pray pardon us!&nbsp;
<i>Mores Hyperboreis desunt</i>. <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a>&nbsp;
The Regent would be grieved, if he knew how these <i>scelerati</i> <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a>
have sorted you.&nbsp; Come, rest and wash&mdash;it will soon be supper-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took Malcolm to an inner court, filled for him a cup of ale, for
his immediate refreshment, and led him to a spout of clear water, in
the side of the rock on which the Castle stood; where a stone basin
afforded the only facilities for washing that the greater part of the
inhabitants of the Castle expected, and, in effect, more than they commonly
used.&nbsp; Malcolm, however, was heartily glad of the refreshment of
removing the dust from his weary face and feet&mdash;and heartily thanked
his protector, in the same dog-Latin.&nbsp; Kennedy waited for him,
and as a great bell began to ring, said &lsquo;<i>Pro c&aelig;n&acirc;</i>,&rsquo;
<a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a> and conducted him
towards the great hall while Malcolm felt much impelled to make himself
known, but was conscious that he had not so comported himself towards
his cousin at Paris as to deserve much favour from him.</p>
<p>A high table was spread in the hall, with the usual appliances befitting
princes and nobles.&nbsp; The other tables, below the dais, were of
the rudest description, and stained with accumulations of grease and
ale; and no wonder, since trenchers were not, and each man hacked a
gobbet for himself from the huge pieces of beef carried round on spits&mdash;nor
would the guests have had any objection, during a campaign, to cook
the meat in the fashion described by Froissart, between themselves and
the saddle.&nbsp; These were the squirearchy; Malcolm&rsquo;s late persecutors
did not aspire to the benches around these boards, or only at second
hand, and for the most part had no seat but the unclean straw and rushes
that strewed the floor.</p>
<p>As James Kennedy entered the hall with Malcolm, there came from another
door, marshalled by the seneschal in full feudal state, the Regent Duke
of Albany himself, his wife, a daughter or two, two sons&mdash;and Malcolm
saw, with beating heart, Lilias herself, pale worn, sorrowful-looking,
grievously altered, but still his own Lily.&nbsp; Others followed, chiefly
knights and attendants, but Malcolm saw no one but Lily.&nbsp; She took
her place dejectedly, and never raised her eyes towards him, even when,
on the Regent&rsquo;s question, &lsquo;What have ye there, Jamie?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Kennedy stood forth and answered that it was a scholar, a student, for
whom he asked the hospitality of his kinsman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is welcome,&rsquo; said the Regent, a man of easy good-nature,
whose chief misfortune was, that being of weak nature, he came between
a wicked father and wickeder sons.&nbsp; He was a handsome man, with
much of the stately appearance of King James himself, and the same complexion;
but it was that sort of likeness which was almost provoking, by seeming
to detract from the majesty of the lineaments themselves, as seen in
him who alone knew how to make them a mask for a great soul.&nbsp; His
two sons, Robert and Alexander, laughed as they saw Kennedy&rsquo;s
companion, and called out, &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s the brotherhood of
learning, is it, Jamie?&mdash;forgathering with any beggar in the street!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Kennedy, nothing daunted, &lsquo;and finding
him much better mannered than you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay!&rsquo; sighed Murdoch, feebly; &lsquo;when I grew up,
it was at the Castles of Perth and Doune that we looked for the best
manners.&nbsp; Now&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We leave them to the lick-platters that have to live by them,&rsquo;
said Alexander, rudely.</p>
<p>Kennedy, meanwhile, gave the young scholar in charge to a gray-headed
retainer, who seemed one of the few who had any remains of good-breeding;
and then offered to say Grace&mdash;he being the nearest approach to
an ecclesiastic present&mdash;as the chaplain was gone to an Easter
festivity at his Abbey.&nbsp; Malcolm thus obtained a seat at the second
table, and a tolerable share of supper; but he could hardly eat, from
intense anxiety, and scarcely knew whether to be glad or sorry that
he was out of sight of Lily.</p>
<p>By and by, a moment&rsquo;s lull of the universal din enabled Malcolm
to hear the Regent saying, &lsquo;Verily, there is a look of gentle
nurture about the lad.&nbsp; Look you, James, when the tables are drawn,
you shall hold a disputation with him.&nbsp; It will be sport to hear
how you chop logic at your Universities yonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm&rsquo;s spirit sank.&nbsp; Such disputations were perfectly
ordinary work at both Oxford and Paris, and, usually, he was quite capable
of sustaining his part in them; but his heart was so full, his mind
so anxious, his condition so dangerous, that he felt as if he could
by no means rally that alertness of argument, and readiness of quotation,
that were requisite even in the merest tyro.&nbsp; However, he made
a great effort.&nbsp; He secretly invoked the Light of Wisdom; tried
to think himself back into the aisles of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, and
to call up the key-notes of some of the stock arguments; hoping that,
if the selection of the subject were left to Kennedy, he would hit on
one of those most familiar at Oxford.</p>
<p>The supper was ended, the tables were removed, and the challenge
took place.&nbsp; Duke Murdoch, leaning back in his high chair by the
peat-fire, while the ladies sat round at their spinning, called for
the two young clerks to begin their tourney of words.&nbsp; They stood
opposite one another, on the step of the dais; and Kennedy, as host
and challenger, assigned to his opponent the choice of a subject, when
Malcolm, brightening, proposed one that he had so often heard and practised
on, as to have the arguments at his fingers&rsquo; ends; namely, that
the real consists only in that which is substantial to the senses, and
which we see, hear, taste, smell, or touch.</p>
<p>Kennedy&rsquo;s shrewd gray eye glanced at him in a manner that startled
him, as he made reply, &lsquo;Fellow-<i>alumnus</i>, you speak as Oxford
scholars speak; but I rede ye well that the real is not that which is
grossly tangible to the corporeal sense, but the idea that is conceived
within the immortal intelligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The argument was carried on in the vernacular, but there was an unlimited
license of quotation from authors of all kinds, classics, Fathers, and
schoolmen.&nbsp; It was like a game at chess, in which the first moves
were always so much alike, that they might have been made by automatons;
and Malcolm was repeating reply and counter-reply, almost by rote, when
a citation brought in by Kennedy again startled him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Outward things,&rsquo; said James, &lsquo;are the mere mark;
for have we not heard how</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Telephus et Peleus, quum pauper et exsul uterque,<br />
Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba&rdquo;?&rsquo; <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was this to prove that he recognized a wandering prince in his opponent?
thought Malcolm; but, much on his guard, he made answer, as usual, in
his native tongue.&nbsp; &lsquo;That which is not touched and held is
but a vain and fleeting shadow&mdash;&ldquo;<i>solvitur in nube</i>.&rdquo;
<a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Negatur</i>, it is denied!&rsquo; said Kennedy, fixing
his eyes full upon him.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Speculum of the Soul, which
is immortal, retains the image even while the bodily presence is far
away.&nbsp; Wherefore else was it that Ulysses sat as a beggar by his
paternal hearth, or that Cadmus wandered to seek his sister?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was anything but the regular illustration&mdash;the argument
was far too directly <i>ad hominem</i>&mdash;and Malcolm hesitated for
a moment, ere framing his reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;If the image had satisfied
the craving of their hearts, they had never wandered, nor endangered
themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor,&rsquo; said Kennedy, &lsquo;endeared themselves to all
who love the leal and the brave, and count these indeed as verities
for which to live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From the manner in which these words were spoken, Malcolm had no
further doubt either that Kennedy knew him, or that he meant to assist
him; and the discussion thenceforth proceeded without further departures
from the regular style, and was sustained with considerable spirit,
till the Regent grew weary of it, and bed-time approached, when Kennedy
announced his intention of taking his fellow-student to share his chamber;
and, as this did not appear at all an unnatural proposal, in the crowded
Castle, Malcolm followed him up various winding stairs into a small
circular chamber, with a loop-hole window, within one of the flanking
towers.</p>
<p>Carefully closing the heavy door, Kennedy held out his hands.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fair cousin,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this is bravely done of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will it save my sister?&rsquo; asked Malcolm, anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It should,&rsquo; said his kinsman; &lsquo;but how can it
be?&nbsp; Whatever is done, must be ere Walter Stewart returns.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me all!&nbsp; I know nothing&mdash;save that she was
cruelly lured from St. Abbs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know little more,&rsquo; said Kennedy.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was
on a false report of your death, and Walter had well-nigh obtained a
forcible marriage; when her resistance and cries to Heaven daunted the
monk who was to have performed the rite, so that he, in a sort, became
her protector.&nbsp; When she was brought here, Walter swore he would
bend her to his will; shut her up in the old keep, and kept her there,
scantily fed, and a close prisoner, while he went forth on one of his
forays.&nbsp; The Regent coming here meantime, found the poor maiden
in her captivity, and freed her so far that she lives, to all appearance,
as becomes his kinswoman; but the Duchess is cruelly strict with her,
being resolved, as she says, to take down her pride.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must know that I live,&rsquo; said Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They do; but Walter is none the less resolved not to be balked.&nbsp;
Things came to a wild pass a few weeks syne.&nbsp; The Regent had never
dared tell him how far matters had gone for bringing back the King,
when one day Walter came in, clad for hawking; and, in his rudest manner,
demanded the falcon that was wont to sit on his father&rsquo;s wrist,
and that had never been taken out by any other.&nbsp; The Regent refused
to part with the bird, as he had oft done before; whereupon his son,
in his fury, snatched her from his wrist, and wrung her head off before
all our eyes; then turning fiercely on your poor sister, told her that
&ldquo;yon gled should be a token to her, of how they fared who withheld
themselves from him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then rose the Duke, trembling within
rage; &ldquo;Ay, Wat,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye hae been owermuch for
me.&nbsp; We will soon have ane at home that will ken how to guide ye.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Walter looked at him insolently, and muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
of this before!&nbsp; They that wad have a master, may live under a
master&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not ane of them;&rdquo; and then, turning
upon Lady Lilias, he pointed to the dead hawk, and told her that, unless
she yielded to him with a good grace, that bird showed her what she
might expect, long ere the King or her brother were across the border.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where is he now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Fife, striving to get a force together to hinder the King&rsquo;s
return.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll not do that; men are too weary of misrule
to join him against King James; but he is like, any day, to come back
with reivers enough to terrify his father, and get your sister into
his hands&mdash;indeed, his mother is ready to give her up to him whenever
he asks.&nbsp; He has sworn to have her now, were it merely to vex the
King and you, and show that he is to be daunted neither by man, heaven,
nor hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he may come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any day or any night,&rsquo; said James.&nbsp; &lsquo;Since
he went I have striven, in vain, to devise some escape for your sister;
but Heaven has surely sent you to hinder so foul a wrong!&nbsp; Yet,
if you went to Glenuskie and raised your vassals&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be loss of time,&rsquo; said Malcolm; &lsquo;and
this matter may not be put to the doubtful issue of a fray between my
men and his villains.&nbsp; Out of this place must she go at once.&nbsp;
But, alas! how win to the speech of her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That can I do,&rsquo; said Kennedy.&nbsp; &lsquo;For a few
brief moments, each day, have I spoken to her in the chapel.&nbsp; Nay,
I had left this place before now, had she not prayed me to remain as
her only friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heaven must requite you, Cousin James,&rsquo; said Malcolm,
warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I deserved not this of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All that I desire,&rsquo; said Kennedy, &lsquo;is to see this
land of ours cease to be full of darkness and cruel habitations.&nbsp;
Malcolm, you know the King better than I; may we not trust that he will
come as a redresser of wrongs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Know you not his pledge to himself?&mdash;&ldquo;I will make
the key keep the castle, and the bracken bush keep the cow, though I
live the life of a dog to bring it about!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God strengthen his hand,&rsquo; said Kennedy, with tears in
his eyes; &lsquo;and bring better days to our poor land.&nbsp; Cousin,
has not your heart burnt within you, to be doing somewhat to bring these
countrymen of ours to better mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have grieved,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;The sight
has been the woe and horror of my whole life; and either it is worse
now than when I went away, or I see it clearer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is both,&rsquo; said Kennedy; &lsquo;and, Malcolm, it is
borne in on me that we, who have seen better things, have a heavy charge!&nbsp;
The King may punish marauders, and enforce peace; but it will be but
the rule of the strong hand, unless men&rsquo;s hearts be moved!&nbsp;
Our clergy&mdash;they bear the office of priests&mdash;but their fierceness
and their ignorance would scarce be believed in France or England; and
how should it be otherwise, with no schools at home save the abbeys&mdash;and
the abbeys almost all fortresses held by fierce noblemen&rsquo;s sons?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm would much rather have discussed the means of rescuing his
sister, but James Kennedy&rsquo;s heart was full of a youth&rsquo;s
ardent plans for the re-awakening of religion in his country, chiefly
through the improved education of the clergy, and it was not easy to
bring his discourse to a close.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&mdash;you were to wed a great Flemish heiress?&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will do your part, Cousin, in the founding
of a University&mdash;such as has changed ourselves so greatly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;My only bride is learning,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;my other betrothal is but in name, for the safety of the
lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; cried Kennedy joyfully, &lsquo;you will give
yourself.&nbsp; Learning and culture turned to God&rsquo;s service,
for this poor country&rsquo;s sake, in one of birth like you, may change
her indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Was this the reading of Esclairmonde&rsquo;s riddle? suddenly thought
Malcolm.&nbsp; Was the true search for heavenly Light, then, to consist
in holding up to his countrymen the lamp he was kindling for himself?&nbsp;
Must true wisdom consist in treasuring knowledge, not for his own honour
among learned men, or the delectation of his own mind, but to scatter
it among these rude northern souls?&nbsp; Must the vision of learned
research and scholarly calm vanish, as cloistral peace, and chivalrous
love and glory, had vanished before? and was the lot of a hard-working
secular priest that which called him?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII: CLERK DAVIE</h2>
<p>For Malcolm to speak with his sister was well-nigh an impossibility.&nbsp;
Had he been detected, he would have been immediately treated as a spy,
and the suspicion thus excited would have been a dangerous preparation
for the King as well as for himself; nor was there any pretext for giving
the wandering scholar an interview with her.</p>
<p>But harsh and strict as was the Duchess of Albany&mdash;a tall, raw-boned,
red-haired woman, daughter of the fierce old Earl of Lennox&mdash;and
resolved as she was to bend Lilias by persecution to accept her son,
she could not debar a young gentleman of the royal kindred, like James
Kennedy, from entering the apartment where the ladies of the family
sat with their needles; and the Regent, half from pity, half from shame,
had refused to permit Lilias Stewart&rsquo;s being treated as a mere
captive.</p>
<p>Thus Malcolm remained in Kennedy&rsquo;s room in much anxiety, while
his cousin went forth to do his best in his cause, and after some hours
returned to him with the tidings that he had succeeded in letting Lily
know that he was in the Castle.&nbsp; Standing over her while she bent
over her embroidery, and thus concealing her trembling agitation, he
had found it possible to whisper in her ears the tidings of her brother
having come to save her, and of hearing her insist that Malcolm, &lsquo;wee
Malcolm, must run no peril, but that she would do and dare everything&mdash;nay,
would prefer death itself to Walter Stewart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you any device in this matter?&rsquo; demanded James
Kennedy, when he had thus spoken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you your college gown here?&rsquo; inquired Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have, in yon kist,&rsquo; said Kennedy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would
you disguise her therein?&nbsp; You and she are nearly of a height.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;The plot I thought on
is this&mdash;the worst is that the risk rests with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is naught, less than naught,&rsquo; said Kennedy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I had risked myself ten times over had I seen any hope for her
in so doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm then explained his plan, namely, that if Lilias could have
Kennedy&rsquo;s gown conveyed to her, she should array herself therein,
and be conducted out of the castle by her cousin by one gate, he himself
in secular garb going by another, and joining at some place of meeting,
whence, as a pair of brothers, Malcolm and she might gain the English
border.</p>
<p>James Kennedy considered, and then added that he could improve on
the plan.&nbsp; He had long intended leaving Doune for his brother&rsquo;s
castle, but only tarried in case he could do anything for Lilias.&nbsp;
He would at supper publicly announce to the Regent his departure for
the next day, and also say that he had detained his fellow-scholar to
go within him.&nbsp; Then arranging for Malcolm&rsquo;s exit in a secular
dress among his escort, as one of the many unobserved loungers, Lilias
should go with him in very early morning in the bachelor&rsquo;s gown,
which he would place in a corner of a dark passage, where she could
find it.&nbsp; Then if Malcolm and she turned aside from his escort,
as the pursuit as soon as her evasion was discovered would be immediately
directed on himself, they would have the more time for escape.</p>
<p>It was a complicated plan, but there was this recommendation, that
Malcolm need not lose sight of his sister.&nbsp; Clerk as he was, young
Kennedy could not ride without an escort, and among his followers he
could place Malcolm.&nbsp; Accordingly at supper he announced his desire
to leave Doune at dawn next morning, and was, as a matter of course,
courteously pressed to remain.&nbsp; Malcolm in the meantime eluded
observation as much as possible while watching his sister, who, in spite
of all her efforts, was pale and red by turns, never durst glance towards
him, and trembled whenever any one went near him.</p>
<p>The ladies at length swept out of the hall, and Robert and Alexander
called for more wine for a rere-supper to drink to James&rsquo;s good
journey; but Kennedy tore himself from their hospitable violence, and
again he and Malcolm were alone, spending a night of anxiety and consultation.</p>
<p>Morning came; Malcolm arrayed himself in a somewhat worn dress of
Kennedy&rsquo;s, with the belt and dirk he had carried under his scholar&rsquo;s
garb now without, and a steel cap that his cousin had procured for him
on his head.&nbsp; With a parcel in his arms of Kennedy&rsquo;s gear,
he might pass for a servant sent from home to meet him; and so soon
as this disguise was complete, Kennedy opened the door.&nbsp; On the
turret stair stood a hooded black figure, that started as the door opened.</p>
<p>Malcolm&rsquo;s heart might well seem to leap to his lips, but both
brother and sister felt the tension of nerve that caution required too
much to give way for a moment.</p>
<p>Kennedy whispered, &lsquo;Your license, fair Cousin,&rsquo; and passed
on with the free step of lordly birth, while a few paces behind the
seeming scholar humbly followed, and Malcolm, putting on his soldier&rsquo;s
tread and the careless free-and-easy bearing he had affected before
Meaux, brought up the rear with Master Kennedy&rsquo;s mails.</p>
<p>As they anticipated, the household was not troubling itself to rise
to see the priest off.&nbsp; Not that this made the coast clear, for
the floor of the hall was cumbered with snoring sleepers in all sorts
of attitudes&mdash;nay, at the upper table, the flushed, debauched,
though young and handsome, faces of Robert and Alexander Stewart might
have been detected among those who lay snoring among the relics of their
last night&rsquo;s revel.</p>
<p>The old steward was, however, up and alert, ready to offer the stirrup-cup,
and the horses were waiting in the court; but what they had by no means
expected or desired was that Duke Murdoch himself, in his long furred
gown, came slowly across the hall to bid his young kinsman Kennedy farewell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speed you well, my lad,&rsquo; he said kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
ask ye not to tarry in what ye must deem a graceless household;&rsquo;
and he looked sadly across at his two sons, boys in age, but seniors
in excess.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would we had mair lads like you.&nbsp; I fear
me a heavy reckoning is coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have ever been good lord to all, Sir,&rsquo; said Kennedy,
affectionately, for he really loved and pitied the soft-hearted Duke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too good, maybe,&rsquo; said Murdoch.&nbsp; &lsquo;What! the
scholar goes with you?&rsquo; and he fixed a look on Lily&rsquo;s face
that brought the colour deep into it under her hood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Sir,&rsquo; answered Kennedy, respectfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here,
you Tam,&rsquo; indicating Malcolm, &lsquo;take him behind you on the
sumpter-horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fare ye weel, gentle scholar,&rsquo; said Murdoch, taking
the hand that Lily was far from offering.&nbsp; &lsquo;May ye win to
your journey&rsquo;s end safe and sound; and remember,&rsquo; he added,
holding the fingers tight, and speaking under the hood, &lsquo;if ye
have been hardly served, &rsquo;twas to make ye the second lady in Scotland.&nbsp;
Take care of her&mdash;him, young laddie,&rsquo; he added, turning on
Malcolm: &lsquo;&rsquo;tis best so; and mind&rsquo; (he spoke in the
same wheedling tone of self-excuse), &lsquo;if ye tell the tale down
south, nae ill hath been dune till her, and where could she have been
mair fitly than beneath her kinsman&rsquo;s roof?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d not
let her go, but that young blude is hot and ill to guide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An answer would have been hard to find; and it was well that he did
not look for any.&nbsp; Indeed, Malcolm could not have spoken without
being heard by the seneschal, and therefore could only bow, take his
seat on the baggage-horse, and then feel his sister mounting behind
him in an attitude less unfamiliar on occasion even to the high-born
ladies of the fifteenth century than to those of our day.&nbsp; Four
years it was since he had felt her touch, four years since she had sat
behind him as they followed the King to Coldingham!&nbsp; His heart
swelled with thankfulness as he passed under the gateway, and the arms
that clung round his waist clasped him fervently; but neither ventured
on a word, amid Kennedy&rsquo;s escort, and they rode on a couple of
miles in the same silence.&nbsp; Then Kennedy, pausing, said, &lsquo;There
lies your way, Brother.&nbsp; Tam, you may show the scholar the way
to the Gray Friars&rsquo; Grange, bear them greetings frae me, and halt
till ye hear from me.&nbsp; Fare ye well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias trusted her voice to say, &lsquo;Blessings on ye, Sir, for
all ye have done for me,&rsquo; but Malcolm thought it wiser in his
character of retainer to respond only by a bow.</p>
<p>Of course they understood that the direction Kennedy gave was the
very one they were not to take, but they followed it till a tall bush
of gorse hid them from the escort; and then Malcolm, grasping his sister&rsquo;s
hand, plunged down among the rowans, ferns, and hazels, that covered
the steep bank of the river, and so soon as a footing was gained under
shelter of a tall rock, threw his arms round her, almost sobbing in
an under-tone, &lsquo;My Lily, my tittie!&mdash;safe at last!&nbsp;
Oh, God be thanked!&nbsp; I knew her prayers would be heard!&nbsp; Oh,
would that Patrick were here!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, as her face changed
and quivered ready to weep, he cried, &lsquo;Eh, what! art still deeming
him dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How!&rsquo; she cried wildly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He fell into the
hands of your English, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He fell into the hands of your King and mine,&rsquo; said
Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, King James dragged him out of the burning
house, and wrung his pardon out of King Harry.&nbsp; He came with me
to St. Abbs to fetch you, Lily, and only went back because his knighthood
would not serve in this quest like my clerkship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Patrick living, Patrick safe!&nbsp; Oh!&rsquo; she fell on
her knees among the ferns, hid her face in her hands, and drew a long
breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;Malcolm, this is joy overmuch.&nbsp; The desolation
of yesterday, the joy to-day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm, seeing her like one stifled by emotion, fell on his knees
beside her, and whispered forth a thanksgiving.&nbsp; She rested with
her head on his shoulder in content till he started up, saying in a
lively manner, &lsquo;Come, Lily, we must be on our way.&nbsp; A very
bonnie young clerk you are, with your berry-brown locks cut so short
round your face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lilias blushed up to the short dark curls she had left herself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Had I thought he lived, I could scarce have done it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, not to get to him, silly maid?&nbsp; Here,&rsquo; as
he shook out and donned the gown he had brought rolled up, &lsquo;now
am I a scholar too.&nbsp; Stay, you must take off this badge of the
bachelor; you have only been in a monastery school, you know; you are
my young brother&mdash;what shall we call you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Davie,&rsquo; softly suggested Lilias.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, Davie then, that I&rsquo;ve come home to fetch to share
my Paris lear.&nbsp; You can be very shy and bashful, you know, and
leave all the knapping of Latin and logic to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is such as you did with Jamie Kennedy,&rsquo; said Lilias,
&lsquo;it will indeed be well.&nbsp; Oh, Malcolm, I sat and marvelled
at ye&mdash;so gleg ye took him up.&nbsp; How could ye learn it?&nbsp;
And ye are a brave warrior too in battles,&rsquo; she added, looking
him over with a sister&rsquo;s fond pride.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have had no battle, no pitched field,&rsquo; said Malcolm
&lsquo;but I have seen war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that ugly words can never be flung in your face again!&rsquo;
cried Lilias.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you knighted, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but they say I have won my spurs.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
you all, Lily, as we walk.&nbsp; Only let me bestow this iron cap where
some mavis may nestle in it.&nbsp; Ay, and the boots too, which scarce
befit a clerk.&nbsp; There, your hand, Clerk Davie; we must make westward
to-day, lest poor Duke Murdoch be forced to send to chase us.&nbsp;
After that, for the Border and Patie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So brother and sister set forth on their wandering&mdash;and truly
it was a happy journey.&nbsp; The weather favoured them, and their hearts
were light.&nbsp; Lilias, delivered from terrible, hopeless captivity,
her brother beside her, and now not a brother to be pitied and protected,
but to protect her and be exulted in, trod the heather with an exquisite
sense of joy and freedom that buoyed her up against all hardships; and
Malcolm was at peace, as he had seldom been.&nbsp; His happiness was
not exactly like his sister&rsquo;s in her renewed liberty and restoration
to love and joy, for he had known a wider range of life, and though
really younger than Lily, his more complicated history could not but
make him older in thought and mind.&nbsp; Another self-abnegation was
beginning to rise upon him, as he travelled slowly southwards by stages
suited to his sister&rsquo;s powers, and by another track than that
by which he had gone.&nbsp; On the moor, or by the burn side, there
was peace and brightness; but wherever he met with man he found something
to sadden him.&nbsp; Did they rest in a monastery, there was often irregularity,
seldom devotion, always crass ignorance.&nbsp; The manse was often a
scene of such dissolute life that Malcolm shunned to bring his sister
into the sight of it; the peel tower was the dwelling of savagery; the
farm homestead either rude and lawless or in constant terror; the black
spaces on many a brae side showed where dwellings had been burned; more
than once they passed skeletons depending from the trees or lying rotting
by the way-side.&nbsp; And it was frightful to Malcolm, after his four
years&rsquo; absence, to find how little Lilias shared his horror, taking
quite naturally what to Alice Montagu would have seemed beyond the bounds
of possibility, and would have set Esclairmonde&rsquo;s soul on fire,
while Lilias seemed to think it her brother&rsquo;s amiable peculiarity
to be shocked, or to long to set such things straight.</p>
<p>He felt the truth of James Kennedy&rsquo;s words&mdash;that reformation
could not be the sole work of the King, but that his hands must be strengthened
by all the few who knew that a different state of things was possible,
and that, above all, the clergy needed to be awakened into vigour and
intelligence.&nbsp; Formerly, the miserable aspect of the country had
merely terrified him, and driven him to strive to hide his head in a
convent; but the strength and the sense of duty he had acquired had
brought his heart to respond to Kennedy&rsquo;s call to work.</p>
<p>Esclairmonde&rsquo;s words wrought within him beyond her own ken
or purpose in speaking them.&nbsp; He began to understand that to bury
himself in an Italian university and dive into Aristotle&rsquo;s sayings,
to heap up his own memory with the stores of thought he loved, or to
plunge into the mazes of mathematics, philosophy, and music, while his
brethren in his own country were tearing one another to pieces for lack
of any good influence to teach or show them better things, would be
a storing of treasure for himself on earth, a pursuit of the light of
knowledge indeed, but not a wooing of the light of Wisdom, the true
Light of the World, as seen in Him who went about doing good.&nbsp;
To complete his present course was, he knew, necessary.&nbsp; He had
seen enough of really learned scholars to know the depths of his own
ignorance, and to be aware that certain books must be read under guidance,
and certain studies gone through, before his cultivation would be on
a level with the standard of the best working clergy of the English
Church&mdash;such as Chicheley, Waynflete, or the like.&nbsp; He would
therefore remain at Oxford, he thought, long enough to take his Master
of Arts degree, and then, though to his own perceptions only the one-eyed
among the blind, he would make the real sacrifice of himself in the
rude and cruel world of Scotland.</p>
<p>He knew that his king was well satisfied with Patrick, and also that
a man of sound heart and prompt, hard hand was far fitter to rule as
a secular lord than his own more fine-drawn mature could ever be; but
as a priest, with the influence that his birth and the King&rsquo;s
friendship would give him, he already saw chances of raising the tone
of the clergy, and thus improving the wild and lawless people.</p>
<p>A deep purpose of self-devotion was growing up in his soul, but without
saddening him, only rendering him more energetic and cheerful than his
sister had ever known him.</p>
<p>As they walked together over the long stretches of moor, many were
Lily&rsquo;s questions; and Malcolm beguiled the way with many a story
of camp and court, told both for his own satisfaction in her sympathy,
and with the desire to make the Scottish lassie see what was the life
and what the thoughts of ladies of her own degree in other lands, so
that the Lady of Glenuskie might be awake to somewhat of the high purpose
of virtuous home government to which Alice of Salisbury had been trained.</p>
<p>As to the Flemish heiress, no representation would induce Lilias
to love her.&nbsp; Reject Malcolm for a convent&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp;
It was unpardonable; and as to a bedeswoman, working uncloistered in
the streets, Lily viewed that as neither the one thing nor the other,
neither religious nor secular; and she was persuaded that a little exertion
on the part of the brother, whom she viewed as a paladin, would overcome
all coyness on the lady&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>Malcolm found it vain to try to show his sister his sense of his
own deserts, and equally so to declare that if the maiden should so
yield, she would indeed be the Demoiselle de Luxemburg to whom he was
pledged, but not the Esclairmonde whom his better part adored.&nbsp;
So he let the matter pass by, and both enjoyed their masquing in one
another&rsquo;s company as a holiday such as they could never have again.</p>
<p>They had no serious alarms; the pursuit must have been disconcerted,
and the two young scholars were not worth the attention of freebooters.&nbsp;
Their winsomeness of manner won them kindness wherever they harboured;
and thus, after many days, without molestation they came to the walls
of Berwick.&nbsp; And now, while Malcolm thought his difficulties at
an end, a horror of bashfulness fell upon Lilias.&nbsp; She had been
Clerk Davie merrily enough while there was no one to suspect her, but
the transmutation into her proper self filled her with shame.</p>
<p>She hung back, and could be hardly dragged forward to the embattled
gateway of the bridge by her brother&mdash;who, as the guards, jealously
cautious even in this time of peace, called out to him to stand, showed
his ring bearing the royal arms, and desired to speak within the captain
of the garrison, who was commanding in the name of the Earl of Northumberland,
Governor of Berwick and Warden of the Marches, and who had entertained
him on his way north, and would have been warned by Patrick of his probable
return in this guise.</p>
<p>Instead of the stalwart form of the veteran sub-governor, however,
a quick step came hurrying to the gateway, and the light figure of a
young knight stood before him, with outstretched hands, crying: &lsquo;Welcome
to the good town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, dear comrade!&rsquo;&nbsp; And
he added in a lower tone: &lsquo;So you have succeeded in your quest&mdash;if,
as I trow, this fairest of clerks be your lady sister.&nbsp; May I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold!&rsquo; softly said Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is so shamefast
that she cannot brook a word;&rsquo; and in fact Lilias had pulled her
hood over her face, and shrunk behind him, at the first approach of
the young gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will to my mother,&rsquo; said Ralf, aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;She
has always a soft corner in her heart for a young clerk or a wanderer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so saying, without even looking at the disguised figure, he gave
the pass-word, and holding Malcolm by the arm, led him, followed by
Lilias, through the defences and into the court of the castle, then
to a side-door, where, bounding up several steps at once of a stone
stair, he opened a sort of anteroom door, and bade the two strangers
wait there while he fetched his mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is well!&nbsp; Who would have looked to see him here!&rsquo;
cried Malcolm, joyously.&nbsp; &lsquo;What, you knew him not?&nbsp;
It was Ralf Percy, my dear old companion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ralf Percy! he that was so bold and daring?&rsquo; cried Lilias.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nay, but how can it be, he was as meek and shamefast&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As yourself,&rsquo; smiled Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, sister,
you have much to learn of the ways of an English gentleman among ladies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before many further words could be exchanged, there entered a fair
and matronly dame in the widow&rsquo;s veil she had worn ever since
the fatal day of Shrewsbury&mdash;that eager, loving, yet almost childish
woman whom we know so well as Hotspur&rsquo;s gentle Kate (only that
unfortunately her name was Elizabeth); fondling, teasing, being fondled
and teased in return, and then with all her pretty puerilities scorched
away when she upbraids Northumberland with his fatal delay.&nbsp; Could
Malcolm and Lilias have known her as we do in Shakespeare, they would
have been the more gratified by her welcome, whereas they only saw her
kind face and the courtly sweep of her curtsey, as, going straight up
to the disguised girl, blushing and trembling now more than ever, she
said: &lsquo;Poor child, come with me, and we will soon have you yourself
again, ere any other eye see you;&rsquo; and then moved away again,
holding Lily by the hand, while Ralf, who had followed close behind
her, again grasped Malcolm&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, Glenuskie; you have all the adventures!&nbsp; They
seek you, I believe!&nbsp; So you have borne off your damosel errant,
and are just in time to receive your king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he wedded then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and you find us all here in full state, prepared to banquet
him and lodge him and his bride for a night, and then I fancy my brother
is to go through some ceremony, ere giving him up to his own subjects.&nbsp;
We are watching for him every day.&nbsp; Come to my chamber, and I&rsquo;ll
apparel you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, but what brings you here, Ralf?&mdash;you, whom I thought
in France.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas a Scottish bill that brought me,&rsquo; answered
Ralf.&nbsp; &lsquo;What, are you too lost in parchment at Oxford to
hear of us poor soldiers, or knew you not how we fought at Crevant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard of the battle, and that you were hurt, but that was
months ago, and I deemed you long since in the field again.&nbsp; Was
it so sore a matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chiefly sore for that it hindered me from taking the old rogue
Douglas, and meriting my spurs as befitted a Percy.&nbsp; I was knighted
while the trumpet was sounding, and I did think that I was on the way
to prowess, for fully in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> I saw a fellow
with the Douglas banner.&nbsp; I made at it, thinking of my father&rsquo;s
and of Otterburn; and, Malcolm, this very hand was on the staff, when
what must a big Scot do but chop at me with his bill like a butcher&rsquo;s
axe.&nbsp; Had it fallen on mine arm it would have been lopped off like
a bough of a tree, but, by St. George&rsquo;s grace, it lit here, between
my neck and shoulder, and stuck fast as I went down, and the fellow
was swept away from me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas so fixed in the very bone,
that they had much ado to wrench it out, when there was time after the
fight to look after us who had come by the worse.&nbsp; And what d&rsquo;ye
think they found, Malcolm?&nbsp; Why, those honest Yorkshiremen, Trenton
and Kitson, stark dead, both of them.&nbsp; Trenton must have gone down
first, with a lance-thrust in the throat; and there was Kitson over
him, his shield over his head, and his own cleft open with an axe!&nbsp;
They laid them side by side&mdash;so I was told&mdash;in their grave;
and sure &rsquo;twas as strange and as true a brotherhood as ever was
between two brave men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The good fellows!&rsquo; cried Malcolm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay,
after what I saw I can hardly grieve.&nbsp; I went to Kitson&rsquo;s
home, where they knew as little as I did of his death, and verily his
place had closed up behind him, so that I scarce think his mother even
cared to see him more, and the whole of them seemed more concerned at
his amity with Trenton than proud of his feats of arms.&nbsp; I was
marvelling if their friendship would be allowed to subsist at home,
even when they, poor fellows, were lying side by side in their French
grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We warriors should never come home,&rsquo; said Percy; &lsquo;we
are spoilt for aught but our French camp.&nbsp; I am wearying to get
back once more, but so long as I cannot swing my sword-arm I must play
the idler here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must have been a fearsome wound,&rsquo; said Malcolm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The marvel is your overgetting it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So say they all; and truly it has lasted no small time.&nbsp;
They shipped me off home so soon as I could leave my bed, and bade me
rest.&nbsp; Nay, and my mother herself came even to London, when my
brother was summoned to Parliament,&mdash;she who had never been there
since the first year after she was wedded!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can scarce complain of such kin as that,&rsquo; said Malcolm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis not the kin, but this petty Border life, that frets
me.&nbsp; Here we move from castle to castle, and now and then come
tidings of a cattle lifting, and Harry dons his helm and rides forth,
but nine times out of ten &rsquo;tis a false alarm, or if it be true,
the thieves have made off, and being time of peace, he, as Warden, cannot
make a raid in return.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sick of the life, after the only
warfare fit for a knight, with French nobles instead of Border thieves;
and back I will.&nbsp; If my right arm will not serve me, the left shall.&nbsp;
I can use a lance indifferent well already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Sir Ralf Percy spoke, a bugle-call rang through the castle.&nbsp;
He started.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hark! that&rsquo;s the warder&rsquo;s horn,&rsquo;
and flying to the door, he soon returned crying&mdash;&lsquo;Your king
is in sight, Malcolm!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How soon will he be here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In less than half an hour.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s time to array
yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take you to my chamber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks,&rsquo; said Malcolm; &lsquo;but this gown is no disguise
to me.&nbsp; I had rather meet the King thus, for it is my fitting garb.&nbsp;
Only I would remove the soil of the journey, and then take my sister
by the hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For this there was ample time, and Malcolm had arranged his hair,
and brushed away the dust from his gown, washed his face and hands,
and made himself look more like an Oxford bachelor, and less like a
begging clerk, than he had of late judged it prudent to appear, ere
Ralf took him to the great hall, where he found Lord Northumberland
and the chief gentlemen of his household, with his mother, Lady Percy,
and his young wife, together with their ladies, assembling for the reception
of their royal guests.</p>
<p>Malcolm was presented to, and kindly greeted by, each of the principal
personages, and then the Earl, Sir Ralf, and their officers went forth
to meet the King at the gateway.&nbsp; Malcolm, however, at his sister&rsquo;s
entreaty, remained with her, for in the doubt whether Patrick were really
at hand, and a fond unreasonable vexation that he had had no part in
her liberation, her colour was coming and going, and she looked as if
she might almost faint in her intense excitement.</p>
<p>But when, marshalled by the two Percies, King James and Queen Joan
had entered the hall, and the blare of trumpets without and rejoicings
within, and had been welcomed with deep reverences by the two ladies,
Ralf said: &lsquo;Sir, methinks you have here what you may be glad to
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And standing aside, he made way for the two figures to stand forth,
one in the plain black gown and hood, the other in the rich robes of
a high-born maiden, her dark eyes on the ground, her fair face quivering
within emotion, as both she and her brother bent the knee before their
royal master.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; cried James, &lsquo;this is well indeed.&nbsp;
Thou hast her, then, lad?&nbsp; See, Patrick!&nbsp; Where is he?&nbsp;
Nay, but, fair wife, I must present thee the first kinswoman of mine
thou hast seen.&nbsp; How didst bring her off, Malcolm?&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he embraced Malcolm with the ardour of a happy man, as he added,
&lsquo;This is all that was wanting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Truly James looked as if nothing were wanting to his joy, as there
he stood after his years of waiting, a bridegroom, free, and on the
borders of his native land.&nbsp; His eyes shone with joy, and there
was a bright energy and alacrity in his bearing that, when Malcolm bethought
him of those former grave movements, and the quiet demeanour as though
only interested by an effort, marked the change from the captive to
the free man.&nbsp; And beautiful Joan, lovelier than ever, took on
her her queenly dignity with all her wonted grace and graciousness.</p>
<p>She warmly embraced Lilias, hailing her as cousin, and auguring joyously
of the future from the sight of this first Stewart maiden whom she had
seen; and the next moment Patrick Drummond, hurrying forward, fell on
his knee before his lady, grasped, kissed, fondled her hand, and struggled
and stammered between his rejoicing over her liberation and despair
that he had no part in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said the King &lsquo;it was well-nigh a madman
whom you sent home to me, Malcolm.&nbsp; He was neither to have nor
to hold; and what he would have had me do, or have let him do, I&rsquo;ll
not say, nor doth he know either.&nbsp; I must hear your story ere I
sleep, Malcolm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King did not ask for it then: he would not brook the exposure
of the disunion and violence of Scotland to the English, especially
the Percies; and it was not till he could see Malcolm alone that he
listened to his history.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cousin,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you have done both bravely
and discreetly.&nbsp; Methinks you have redeemed my pledge to your good
guardian that in the south you should be trained to true manhood; though
I am free to own that &rsquo;twas not under my charge that you had the
best training.&nbsp; How is it to be, Malcolm?&nbsp; Patrick tells me
you saw the Lady of Light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, Sir, but neither her purpose nor mine is shaken.&nbsp;
My lord, I believe I see how best to serve God and yourself.&nbsp; If
you will consent, I will finish my first course at Oxford, and then
offer myself for the priesthood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not hide thyself in cloister or school&mdash;that is well!&rsquo;
exclaimed the King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Sir.&nbsp; Methinks I could serve yonder rude people best
if I were among them as a priest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James considered, then said: &lsquo;I pledged myself not to withstand
your conscience, Malcolm; and though I grieve that the lady should be
lost, she has never wavered, and cannot be balked of her will.&nbsp;
Godly and learned priests will indeed be needed; and between you and
James Kennedy, when both are come to elder years, we may perchance lift
our poor Scottish Church to some clearer sense of what a church should
be.&nbsp; Meanwhile&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; The King stopped and considered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Study in England!&nbsp; Ay!&nbsp; You see, Malcolm, I must take
my seat, and have the reins of my unruly steed firm in my hand, ere
I take cognizance of these offences.&nbsp; The caitiff Walter&mdash;mansworn
that he is&mdash;he shall abye it; but that can scarce be as yet, and
methinks it were not well that I entered Scotland with you and your
sister at my side, for then must I seem to have overlooked an offence
that, by this holy relic, I will never pardon.&nbsp; So, Malcolm, instead
of entering Scotland with me&mdash;bonnie land, how sweet its air blows
from the north!&mdash;ye must e&rsquo;en turn south!&nbsp; But how to
dispose of your sister?&nbsp; Some nunnery&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Lily, she is weary of convents,&rsquo; said Malcolm &lsquo;but
if Lady Montagu would let her be with her and the Lady Esclairmonde,
then would she learn somewhat of the ways of a well-ordered English
noble house.&nbsp; And I could well provide for her being there as befits
her station.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well thought of!&nbsp; The gentle Lady Alice will no doubt
welcome her,&rsquo; said the King; &lsquo;and Patrick must endure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus then was it fixed.&nbsp; The King and Queen, stately and beautiful,
royally robed, and mounted on splendid steeds, were escorted the next
morning to the Scottish gate of Berwick by Lord Northumberland and his
retinue, and they were met by an imposing band of Scottish nobles, with
the white-haired Earl of Lennox at their head.&nbsp; To these the captive
was formally surrendered by Northumberland; and James, flinging himself
from his horse, kissed his native soil, and gave thanks aloud to God,
ere he stood up and received the homage of his subjects, to most of
whom he was a total stranger.</p>
<p>Malcolm and Lilias on the walls could see all, but could not hear,
and finally beheld the glittering troop wind their way over the hills
to make ready for the coronation of James and Joan as king and queen
of Scotland.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX: THE LION&rsquo;S WRATH</h2>
<p>It was the 24th of May, 1425, when in the vaulted hall of the Castle
of Stirling the nobles of Scotland were convened to try, as the peers
of the realm, men of rank&mdash;no less than Murdoch, Duke of Albany,
his sons Walter and Alexander, the Earl of Lennox, and twenty-two other
nobles, most of whom had been arraigned in the Parliament of Perth two
months previously, and had been shut up in different castles.&nbsp;
Robert Stewart had escaped to the Highlands; and Walter&mdash;who had
neither been at the Coronation of Scone, nor at the Parliament of Perth,
nor indeed had ever bowed his pride so as to present himself to the
King at all&mdash;had been separately arrested, and shut up for two
months in the strong castle on the Bass Rock.</p>
<p>The charge was termed treason and violence; and assuredly there had
been perpetual acts of spoil and barbarous infractions of the law by
men who deemed themselves above all law.&nbsp; The only curiosity was,
for which of these acts they were to be tried, and this affected many
of their judges likewise; for there was hardly a man in that court who
was not conscious of some deed that would not exactly bear to be set
beside the code of Scotland, and who had not been in the habit of regarding
those laws as all very well for burghers, but not meant for gentlemen.</p>
<p>There, on seats behind the throne, sat the twenty-one jurors, Earl
Douglas among them&mdash;a new earl, for the grim old Archibald had
died in the battle of Verneuil some months before.&nbsp; Angus, March,
and Mar, and all the most powerful names in Scotland, were there; and
upon his throne, in regal robes of crimson and ermine, the crown upon
his brow, the sceptre in his hand, the sword of state held before him,
sat King James, the most magnificent-looking king then reigning in Europe,
but with the sternest, saddest, most resolute of countenances, as one
unalterably fixed upon the terrible duty of not bearing the sword in
vain.&nbsp; Something of Henry&rsquo;s avenging-angel look seemed to
have passed into his face, but with far more of melancholy weight.</p>
<p>Walter Stewart was led into the court.&nbsp; He too was a man of
lofty stature and princely bearing, and his grand Stewart features were
set in an expression of easy nonchalance and scorn; aware as he was
that of whatever he might be accused, there were few of his judges that
did not share the guilt, and moreover persuaded that this was a mere
ceremony, and that the King would never dare to go beyond this futile
attempt to overawe him.&nbsp; He stood alone&mdash;his father and the
others were reserved for another trial; and as, richly arrayed, he stood
opposite to the jury, gazing fixedly first at one, then at the other,
as though challenging their right to sit in judgment on him, one eye
after another fell beneath his gaze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Walter Stewart of Albany, Earl of Fife,&rsquo; proclaimed
the crier&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;You stand here arraigned of murder
and of robbery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At whose suit?&rsquo; demanded Walter, undaunted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the suit of Malcolm and Lilias Stewart of Glenuskie; and
of Patrick Drummond of the Braes,&rsquo; returned the crier, an ecclesiastic,
as were all lawyers; and at the same moment three figures came forward,
namely, a tall knightly gentleman with gold chain and spurs, a lady
whose veil disclosed a blushing dark-eyed face, and a slender youth
of deep and earnest countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;At the suit of these here
present you stand arraigned, Sir Walter Stewart of Albany, for having
feloniously, and of malice aforethought, on the Eve of the Annunciation
of our Lady, of the year of grace 1421, set upon the said Malcolm and
Lilias Stewart, Sir David Drummond of the Braes, Tutor of Glenuskie,
and divers other persons, on the muir of Hetherfield; and having there
cruelly and maliciously wounded the said David of the Braes to the death;
and of having forcibly stolen and abducted the person of the said Lilias
Stewart&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The crier was not permitted to proceed, for Walter Stewart broke
forth, passionately addressing the jurors.&nbsp; &lsquo;So this is all
that can be found to be laid against me.&nbsp; This is the way that
matters of five years back are raked up to vex the princes and nobles
of Scotland.&nbsp; I am sorry for you, lords and gentlemen, if this
is the way that vexatious are to be stirred up against those who have
defended their country so long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is no answer to the accusation, Sir Walter,&rsquo; said
the Earl of Mar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Accusation, forsooth!&rsquo; said Walter Stewart scornfully.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who dares to bear witness, if I <i>did</i> maintain my father&rsquo;s
lawful authority over peevish runaway wards of the Crown?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir Walter,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;you would have done
better to have waited and heard the whole indictment ere answering one
charge.&nbsp; But since you demand who will dare to bear witness in
this matter of the murder of Sir David Drummond of the Braes, and of
the seizure of the Lady Lilias, here is one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, and rising as he spoke, he held forth the reliquary that
hung from a chain round his neck, keeping his gleaming tawny eyes fixed
steadily straight upon Walter Stewart&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>That face, as he first had stood up, expressed the utmost amazement,
and this gradually, under the lion glance, became more and more of dismay,
quailing, collapsing visibly under the passionless gravity of that look.&nbsp;
Even the tall form seemed to shrink, the eyes dilated, the brows drew
closer together, and the chest seemed to pant, as the relic was held
forth.&nbsp; There was a dead silence throughout the court as the King
ceased to speak; only he continued to bend that searching gaze upon
his prisoner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it you?&mdash;was it your own self, my lord?&rsquo; he
stammered forth at last, in the tone of one stricken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yea, Walter Stewart.&nbsp; To me it was, and on this holy
relic, that you made oath to abstain from all further spoil and violence
until the King should come again in peace.&nbsp; How that oath has been
kept the further indictments will show.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I deemed it was St. Andrew,&rsquo; faltered the prisoner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And therefore that the oath to a heavenly saint would better
bear breaking than one to an earthly sinner,&rsquo; replied James gravely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Read on, Clerk of the Court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The roll continued&mdash;a long and terrible record of violence and
cruelty; the private warfare of the lawless young prince, the crimes
of reckless barbarity and of savage passion&mdash;a deadly roll, in
which indeed even the second abduction of Lilias was one of the least
acts laid to his charge.</p>
<p>No lack of witnesses were there to prove deeds that had been done
in the open face of day, in utter fearlessness of earthly justice, and
defiance of Heaven.&nbsp; The defence that the prisoner seemed to have
been prepared to us?&mdash;that those who sat to judge him had shared
in his offences, and his daring power of brow-beating them, as he had
so often done before, as son of the man who sat in the King&rsquo;s
seat&mdash;had utterly failed him now.&nbsp; He was mute; and the forms
of the trial were gone through as of one whose doom was already sealed,
but who must receive his sentence according to the strictest form of
law, lest the just reward of his deeds should partake of their own violence.&nbsp;
By the end of the day the jurors had found Walter Stewart guilty; and
the doomster, a black-robed clerk, rising up, pronounced the sentence
that condemned Walter Stewart of Albany to suffer death by beheading.</p>
<p>Even then no one believed that the doom would be inflicted.&nbsp;
Royal blood had never flowed beneath the headsman&rsquo;s axe; and it
would have been infinitely more congenial to Scottish feelings if the
King had sent a party of men-at-arms to fall on the Master in the high
road, and cut him off, or had burnt him alive in his castle.&nbsp; The
verdict &lsquo;served him right&rsquo; would have been universally returned,
and rejoiced in; but a regular trial of a man of such birth was unheard
of, and shocking to the feelings even of those whom that irresistible
force of the King&rsquo;s had compelled to sit in judgment upon him.&nbsp;
No one could avow it face to face with the King; but every one felt
it an outrage to find that no rank was exempt from law.</p>
<p>Duke Murdoch, his son Alexander, and his father-in-law Lennox, were
tried the next day, and many a deed of dark treason was laid to their
charge.&nbsp; The Earl of Lennox had been the scourge of Scotland for
more than half the eighty years of his life, but his extreme age might
have excited some pity; Murdoch had erred rather negatively than positively;
and Alexander, ruffian as he was, had been bred to nothing better.&nbsp;
Each had deserved the utmost penalty of the law again and again, and
yet there did seem more scope for mercy in their case than in that of
Walter.</p>
<p>But the King was inexorable.&nbsp; He set Malcolm aside as he had
set others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what you would say, lad.&nbsp; Lennox is old, and Alexander
is young, and Albany is a fool; and Walter has injured you, so you are
bound to speak for him.&nbsp; Take it all as said.&nbsp; But these are
the men who have been foremost in making our country a desert!&nbsp;
Did I pardon them, with what face could I ever make any man suffer for
crime?&nbsp; And, in the state of this land, ruth to the guilty high
would be treason to the sackless low.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Stirling saw the unprecedented sight of three generations suffering
for their crimes upon the same scaffold&mdash;the white-haired Lennox,
the Duke of Albany in the prime of life, Walter in the flush and strength
of early manhood, Alexander in the bloom of youth.&nbsp; They all met
their fate undauntedly; for if Murdoch&rsquo;s heart in any measure
failed him, he was afraid to give way in presence of the proud bold
Walter, who maintained an iron rigidity of demeanour with the wild fortitude
of a Red Indian at the stake, and in like manner could by no means comprehend
that King James acted from any motive save malice, for having been so
long kept out of his kingdom.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was his turn now,&rsquo;
said poor Murdoch, even when most desirous of bringing himself to die
in a state of Christian forgiveness; nor could any power on earth show
any of the criminals that the King acted in the eternal interests of
right and justice.</p>
<p>Thus it was with the whole country; and when the four majestic-looking
men stood bare-headed on the scaffold, in view even of their own fair
towers of Doune, and one by one bowed their heads on the block, perverse
Scottish nature broke out into pity for their fate, and wrath against
the King, who could thus turn against his own blood, and disgrace the
royal lineage.</p>
<p>On that same day Malcolm received Esclairmonde&rsquo;s token, there
being at present full peace with England, and set forth on her summons.&nbsp;
He met her at Pontefract, where she was residing with the Dowager Queen
Joan of Navarre, Alice of Salisbury having been summoned to return to
her husband in France.</p>
<p>There then it was that Malcolm and Esclairmonde, in presence of the
chaplain, gave each other back the rings, and therewith their troth
to wed none other, and were once more declared free.</p>
<p>Esclairmonde held out her hand to Malcolm, saying, &lsquo;The thanks
I owe you, Sir, are beyond what tongue can tell.&nbsp; May He to Whom
my first vows were due requite it to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Malcolm, with his knee to the ground, pressing for the last time
that fair hand, said, &lsquo;The thanks, lady, are mine.&nbsp; Had you
been one whit lower in aims or in constancy, what had I been?&nbsp;
You were my light of the world, but to light me to seek that higher
Light that shone forth in you, and which may I show truly to the darkened
spirits of my countrymen!&nbsp; Lady, you will permit me to take to
myself the ring you have worn so long.&nbsp; It will be my token of
my betrothal to that true Light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such was their parting, when the one went forth to her tasks of charity
among the poor in London, the other to divest himself of land and lordship
on behalf of his sister and her husband, and then to begin his task
in the priesthood, of trying to hold up the true Light to hearts darkened
by many an age of crime and ignorance.</p>
<p>Lived very happy ever after!&nbsp; Yes, we would fain always leave
the creatures with whom our thoughts have been busy in such felicity;
but when we have linked them with real events, the sense of the veritable
course of history reminds us that we cannot even suppose beings possible
in real life without endowing them with the common lot of humanity;
and the personages of our tale lived in a time of more than ordinary
reverse and trouble.</p>
<p>Yet Sir Patrick Drummond and Lilias his wife, the Lord and Lady of
Glenuskie, nearly did fulfil these conditions.&nbsp; They had not feelings
beyond their age, but they were good specimens of that age, and they
did their duty in it; he as a trustworthy noble, ready to aid in council
or war, and she as the beneficent dame, bringing piety and charity to
heal the sufferings of her vassals and serfs.&nbsp; His hand was strong
enough to repel the attacks of his foes; her intelligence, backed by
Malcolm&rsquo;s counsel, introduced improvements; and the little ravine
of Glenuskie was a happy valley of peace and prosperity for many years
among the convulsions of Scotland.</p>
<p>Nor was Esclairmonde de Luxemburg&rsquo;s life in the Hospital of
St. Katharine otherwise than the holy and beneficent career that she
had always longed for&mdash;worshipping in the fair church, and going
forth from thence &lsquo;into the streets and lanes of the city,&rsquo;
to fulfil Queen Philippa&rsquo;s pious behest, to seek out the suffering
and the ignorant, and to tend and instruct them.&nbsp; The tall form
and beautiful countenance of Sister Clare were loved and reverenced
as those of an angel messenger among the high houses and courts that
closed in on the banks of the Thames; and while Luxemburgs in France
and Flanders intrigued and fought, plotted and fell, their kinswoman&rsquo;s
days passed by in busy alms-deeds and ever loftier devotion, till those
who watched her steps felt that she was verily a light of the world,
manifesting forth the true Light in many a dark place.</p>
<p>And her light of sympathy shone upon many an old friend both in joy
and in grief.&nbsp; When the dissensions of Gloucester and Beaufort
had summoned Bedford to England to endeavour to appease their strife,
his Burgundian Duchess sought out her early friend, and Esclairmonde
saw her gentle companion, the Lady Anne, fulfilling her daily task of
mediation, and living a life, not indeed very sunshiny, but full of
all that esteem and respect could give her, and of calm gratitude and
affection, although Anne, like all others, believed that John of Bedford&rsquo;s
heart had been buried in his brother&rsquo;s grave, and that of youthful
love he had none to give.&nbsp; His whole soul was absorbed in his care
for the welfare of the pale, gentle, dreamy, inanimate boy, who, from
his very meekness and docility, gave so little promise of representing
the father whose name he bore.</p>
<p>The loving Alice of Montagu, though the mother of many a bold boy
and girl, and busy with all the cares of the great Nevil household,
regarded as the chief delight in a journey to court the sight of her
dear Sister Clare.&nbsp; It was to Sister Clare that Alice turned for
comfort when her brave old father died at the siege of Orleans; and
it was while daily soothing and ministering to her sorrow that Esclairmonde
heard the strange wild tales of the terrible witch maiden who had appeared
on behalf of the French, and turned whole English armies to flight,
by power that the French declared to come from the saints, but which
the English never doubted to be infernal.&nbsp; Maimed and wounded soldiers,
whom Esclairmonde relieved and tended as they returned from lost battles,
gave her fearful accounts of the panic that La Pucelle inspired.&nbsp;
Even the hardy veteran, Sir John Fastolfe, had not been able to withstand
her spells, but had fled from the field of Jergeau, where gallant Sir
Ralf Percy had died, in a vain attempt to gather the men to resist the
irresistible maiden.&nbsp; His groom, who had succumbed for a time to
wounds and weakness on his way home to Alnwick, was touched by the warmth
and emotion with which the kind bedeswoman listened to his lamentation
over the good and loyal knight, whom she pictured to herself resisting
the enchantress&rsquo;s dread power as dauntlessly as he had defied
the phantoms of the Dance of Death.</p>
<p>No whisper ever reached Esclairmonde that the terrible Pucelle was
a maiden as pure and high-souled as herself.&nbsp; All that she heard
more was that this terror of the English and Burgundians was taken,
imprisoned for a time by her own Luxemburg kindred, and then carried
to Rouen, where the kind Duchess Anne of Bedford did her best to persuade
her to overcome the superstition that kept her in male garments, thus
greatly tending to increase the belief in her connection with the powers
of evil.&nbsp; French and Burgundian bishops, and even the University
of Paris, were the judges of the maiden; and the dastard prince she
had crowned never stirred a finger nor uttered a protest in her behalf.&nbsp;
Bedford, always disposed to belief in witchcraft, acquiesced in the
decision of Churchmen, which was therefore called the judgment of the
Church; but when he removed himself and his duchess from Rouen, and
left the conduct of the matter to the sterner and harder Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, it was with little thought that after-generations would
load his memory with the fate of Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, as though her sufferings
had proceeded from his individual malice.</p>
<p>Esclairmonde never saw Bedford again, and only heard through Alice,
now Countess of Salisbury, how when good Duchess Anne was dead, and
her gentle influence removed, Burgundy&rsquo;s disinclination to the
English cause was no longer balanced; and how Bedford, perplexed, disheartened,
broken in health, but still earnest to propitiate friends for his helpless
nephew, had listened to the wily whisper of the Bishop of Th&eacute;rouenne,
that his niece, Jaquette, would secure the devotion of the Count de
St. Pol, and that she was moreover like unto another Demoiselle de Luxemburg.</p>
<p>How like, Esclairmonde could judge, when her kinswoman, widowed in
her eighteenth year, at six months&rsquo; end, came to London to claim
her dower.&nbsp; Never, since her days of wandering and anxiety, had
Esclairmonde felt such pain as when she perceived how little store the
thoughtless girl had set by the great and noble spirit that had been
quenched under the load of toil and care with which it had battled for
thirteen long years.&nbsp; Faithful, great-hearted Bedford, striving
to uphold a losing cause, to reconcile selfish contentions, to retain
conquests that, though unjustly made, he had no power to relinquish;
and all without one trustworthy relation, with friends and fellow-warriors
dying, disputing, betraying, or deserting, his was as self-devoted and
as mournful a career as ever was run by any prince at any age of the
world; and while he slept in his grave at Rouen, that grave which even
Louis XI. respected, Esclairmonde, as, like a true bedeswoman of St.
Katharine, she joined in the orisons for the repose of the souls of
the royal kindred, never heard the name of the Lord John without a throb
of prayer, and a throb too that warmed her heart with tenderness.</p>
<p>It was some four years later, and the even tenor of Sister Clare&rsquo;s
course had only been interrupted by her kinswoman, Jaquette, making
her way to her to confess her marriage with Richard Wydville, and to
entreat her intercession with the Luxemburg family; when one summer
night she was called on to attend a pilgrim priest from the Holy Land,
who had been landed from a Flemish vessel, and lay dangerously sick
at the &lsquo;God&rsquo;s house,&rsquo; or hospital, by the river side.&nbsp;
He was thought by his accent to be foreign, and Sister Clare was always
called on to wait upon the stranger.</p>
<p>As she stood by his bedside, she beheld a man of middle age, but
wasted with sickness, and with a certain strange look of horror so imprinted
on his brow, that even as he lay asleep, though his mouth was grave
and peaceful, the lines were still there, and the locks that hung from
around his tonsure were of a whiteness that scarce accorded with the
features.&nbsp; It was a face that Esclairmonde could not look at without
waking strange memories; but it was not till the sleeper awakened, opened
two dark eyes, gazed on her with dreamy doubtful wonder, and then clasped
his hands with the murmured thanksgiving, &lsquo;My God, hast Thou granted
me this?&nbsp; Light of my life!&rsquo; that she was assured to whom
she was speaking.</p>
<p>Malcolm Stewart it verily was.&nbsp; Canon Malcolm Stewart of Dunkeld
was his proper title, for he had, as she knew, long ceased to be Lord
of Glenuskie.&nbsp; It was not at first that she knew how he had been
brought where she now saw him; but after some few days of her tender
care and skilful leechcraft, he somewhat rallied, and she gathered his
history from his conversation when he was able to speak.</p>
<p>He had had a time of happy labour in Scotland, fully carrying out
the designs with which he and his cousin James Kennedy had taken upon
them the ministry.&nbsp; Their own birth, and the appointments their
King gave them, so soon as their age permitted, made them able to exert
an influence that told upon the rude and unenlightened clergy around.&nbsp;
It had been almost a mission of conversion, to awaken a spirit of Christianity
in the country, that had so long been a prey to anarchy.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s
declaration, &lsquo;I will make the key keep the castle, and the bracken-bush
keep the cow, though I live the life of a dog to bring it about,&rsquo;
had been the moving spring of their lives.&nbsp; James had fought hour
by hour with the foul habits of lawlessness, savagery, and violence,
that had hitherto been absolutely unchecked; and while he strove with
the sword of justice, the two young priests worked within the Word of
truth, to implant some sense of conscience in the neglected people.</p>
<p>It had been a life of constant exertion, but full of hope and cheerfulness.&nbsp;
Amid that rude country, James&rsquo;s own home was always a bright spot
of peace, sunshine, and refinement.&nbsp; With his beloved queen, and
their fair little brood of children, the King cast aside his cares,
and was all, and more than all, he had been as the ornament of Henry&rsquo;s
Court.&nbsp; There all that was sweet, innocent, and beautiful was to
be found; and there Malcolm, his royal kinsman&rsquo;s confidant, counsellor,
and chaplain, was always welcome as one of the home circle and family,
till he broke away from such delights to labour in his task of reviving
religion in the land.&nbsp; A little band of men were gathering round,
clergy awakening from their sloth or worldliness, young nobles who began
to see what chivalry meant, burghers who rejoiced in order; and hope
and encouragement strengthened the hands of the three kinsmen.</p>
<p>But, alas! there were those who deemed James&rsquo;s justice on the
savage prince and noble mere sacrilege on high blood, and who absolutely
hated and loathed peace and order.&nbsp; Those thirteen years of cheerful
progress ended in that murder so unspeakably horrible in all its circumstances,
which almost merits the name of a martyrdom to right and justice.&nbsp;
Malcolm so shuddered when he did but touch on it, and was so rent with
agitation, that Esclairmonde perceived that when his beloved King had
perished, he had indeed received the death-wound to his own fragile
nature.</p>
<p>He had been actually in the Abbey of Perth; and had been one of those
who lifted the mangled corpse from the vault, and sought in vain for
a remnant of life, if but to grant the absolution, for which the victim
had so piteously besought his murderers.&nbsp; No wonder that Fastern&rsquo;s
E&rsquo;en had whitened Malcolm&rsquo;s hair!</p>
<p>But when the assassins were captured, and Joan of Beaufort was resolved
that their death should be as atrocious as their crime, it was Malcolm
who strove to bend her to forgiveness.&nbsp; He bade her recollect King
Henry, and how, when dealing with that cruel monster, the Castellane
of Meaux, he had merely required death, without enhancing the agony;
but Joan, in her rage and misery, had left the Englishwoman behind her,
and was implacable.&nbsp; All that human cruelty could invent was to
be the lot of Robert Graham and his associates; and whereas they had
granted no priest to their victim, none should be granted to them.</p>
<p>And then it was that all Malcolm had learnt of the true spirit of
the Christian triumphed&mdash;not only over the dark Keltic spirit of
revenge, but over the shuddering of a tender and pitiful nature.&nbsp;
Where no other priest durst venture, he went.&nbsp; Through all the
frightful and protracted sufferings of Athol, Graham, Hall, and the
rest, it was Malcolm Stewart who, never flinching, prayed with and for
them; gathered their agonized sobs of confession, or strove to soften
their hardness; spoke the words of absolution, and commended their departing
souls.</p>
<p>When he awoke from the long unconsciousness and delirium that ensued
upon the force he had put on himself, he found himself tended by his
sister at Glenuskie.&nbsp; Patrick Drummond had transported him thither;
finding that the angry Queen, in the madness of her vindictiveness,
was well-nigh disposed to connect him with the treasonable designs of
Athol and Graham.&nbsp; He slowly and partially recovered, but his influence
was gone; the Queen would not brook the sound of his name, the little
king was beyond his reach, James Kennedy was biding his time, and the
country was returned to its state of misrule and violence, wherein an
individual priest could do little: yet Malcolm would have held by his
post, had not his health been so utterly shattered that he was incapable
of the work he had hitherto done, as a confessor and a preacher.&nbsp;
And therefore, as the state of his beloved King, &lsquo;sent to his
account unhouselled, disappointed, unannealed,&rsquo; hung heavy on
his mind, he determined, so soon as he was in any degree convalescent,
to set forth on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the object of so many dreams
of King Henry; there to offer masses and prayers for the welfare of
his departed prince, as well as of the unhappy murderers, and for the
country in its distracted condition.</p>
<p>And there, at the Holy Sepulchre, had Malcolm, in the fervour of
his heart, offered the greatest treasure he possessed&mdash;nay, the
only one that he still really cared for&mdash;namely his betrothal ring,
which Esclairmonde had worn for so long and had returned to him.&nbsp;
As a priest, he had deemed that it was not unlawful for him to retain
the memorial of the link that had bound him to her who had been the
light that led him to the true Light beyond; but as youth passed away,
as devotion burned brighter, as the experiences of those years became
more dream-like, and the horror, grief, and misery of his King&rsquo;s
death had been assuaged only by the steadier contemplation of the Light
of Eternity, he had felt that this last pledge of his once lower aims
and hopes ought to be resigned; and that if it cost him a pang, it was
well that it should be so, to render the offering a sacrifice.&nbsp;
So the ring that had once been Esclairmonde&rsquo;s protection was laid
on the altar of the Holy Tomb.</p>
<p>There Malcolm had well-nigh died, under the influences of agitation,
fatigue, and climate; but he had revived enough to set out on his return
from his pilgrimage, and had made his way tardily and wearily, losing
his attendants through death and desertion on the road; and passing
from one religious house to another, as his strength and nearly exhausted
means served him.&nbsp; Unable to find any vessel bound for Leith, he
had taken ship for London; concealing his quality, lest, in the always
probable contingency of a war, it might lead to his being made prisoner;
and thus he had arrived, sick indeed unto death, but peaceful, rejoicing,
and hopeful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sister,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the morn that I had offered
my ring, I was feeble and faint; and when I knelt on before the altar
in continued prayer&mdash;I know not whether I slept or whether it were
a vision, but it was to me as though I were again on the river, and
again the hymn of Bernard of Morlaix was sung around and above me, by
the voice I never thought to hear again.&nbsp; I looked up, and behold
it was I that was in the boat&mdash;my King was there no more.&nbsp;
Nay, he stood on the shore, and his eyes beamed on me; while the ghastly
wounds that I once strove in anguish to staunch shone out like a ruby
cross on his breast&mdash;the hands, that were so sorely gashed, were
to me as though marked by the impress of the Sacred Wounds.&nbsp; He
spake not; but by his side stood King Henry, beautiful and spirit-like,
and smiled on me, and seemed as though he pointed to the wounds, as
he said, &ldquo;Blessed is the king who died by his people&rsquo;s hand,
for withstanding his people&rsquo;s sin!&nbsp; Blessed is every faint
image of the true King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then methought they held out their arms to me; and I would
have come to them on their shore of rest, but the river bore me away&mdash;and
I looked up, to find I was as yet only in the earthly Jerusalem; but
I watch for them every hour, to call me once and for ever.&rsquo;</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
